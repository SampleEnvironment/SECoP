name: PowerSupply
version: 1
description: |
  A power supply consisting of current and voltage regulation modules.
  The active module can be switched with the parameter `control_active`.
modules:
  current:
    definition: Drivable:1
    description: Controls the current.
    properties:
      # This property has a general definition, but here the description
      # defines a required value.
      quantity:
        definition: quantity:1
        description: Must be set to "current".
    parameters:
      # This parameter is already defined by Drivable, but the required
      # datainfo is made more concrete by this definition.
      value:
        datainfo: numeric, has unit Ampere
      # This parameter is completely specific to this module.
      voltage_limit:
        description: |
          Compliance voltage applied when supply is in current mode.
        datainfo: numeric, has unit Volts
        optional: true
      power_limit:
        description: |
          Power limit applied when supply is in current mode.
        datainfo: numeric, has unit Watts
        optional: true
      control_active:
        definition: control_active:1
        description: |
          If true, power supply is in current mode.
          Setting `voltage:control_active` resets this to false.

    definition: Readable:1
    description: Readback for the measured resistance.
    optional: true
    parameters:
      value:
        datainfo: numeric, has unit Ohms.
      quantity:
        definition: quantity:1
        description: Must be set to "resistance".
