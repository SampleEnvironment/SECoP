Summary
=======

This RFC proposes a way to define and implement "systems", which are collections
of SECoP modules provided by a SEC node that function and interact with defined
semantics.

This allows the definition of facility-specific and inter-facility standards for
control and metadata collection beyond the level of "a sensor" or "an analog
output", towards the level of "a cryomagnet".


Goal
====

All current standard SECoP interface entities (interface classes, standard
accessibles and so on) refer to a single module.

However, in most cases, it is not desirable (or even possible) to represent a
complex piece of hardware equipment by a single module.  In fact, since SECoP
encourages the use of standard interface classes like ``Readable``, the main
"process variables" of the equipment must be represented by a module's ``value``
parameter each, while other parameters are used for ancillary information or
configuration of the module.

Therefore, the notion of a "system" is introduced, which encompasses a
collection of modules that work and interact in a defined way.

As always, the definition of a system specifies the *minimum* interface
required, and may contain optional entities.  More entities can always be
introduced by each implementation.


Technical explanation
=====================

Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like other standard entities, a system will be defined by the SECoP
specification.

It will specify both the *name* of each required module, and its *interface* (an
interface class, and/or additional accessibles).

The SEC node will have a new property that lists the systems contained in it,
with a mapping of system-given module names to actual modules in the node.

Systems can derive from other systems, and contain other systems as subgroups of
their modules.

Preferably, if RFC-002 is implemented, systems will be able to be specified in a
semi-machine-readable manner using YAML definition files, just like other
interface entities.

Referencing Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the SECNode descriptive data, the optional property ``systems`` is
introduced.  It is a JSON object with local system names as keys and the
schema name of the system and a mapping of module names as the value.  For a
system to be valid, all non-optional modules that are included in the system
definition have to be present.

Example:

.. code:: json

    "systems": {
        "cryo1": [
            "OrangeCryostat",
            {
                "T": "cryo1_T",
                "HeLevel": "cryo1_helevel",
            },
        ],
    },


For subsystems, the mapping dictionary can be nested:

.. code:: json

    "systems": {
        "mag5t": [
            "VectorMagnet",
            {
                "T": "magtemp",
                "X": [
                    "PowerSupply",
                    {
                        "current": "magcur_x",
                        "voltage": "magvolt_x"
                    }
                ],
                "Y": [
                    "PowerSupply",
                    {
                        "current": "magcur_y",
                        "voltage": "magvolt_y"
                    }
                ],
                "Z": [
                    "PowerSupply",
                    {
                        "current": "magcur_z",
                        "voltage": "magvolt_z"
                    }
                ],
            },
        ],
    },
