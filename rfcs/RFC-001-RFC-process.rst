Summary
=======

This document describes the SECoP-RFC process that is intended to replace the
previous SECoP-Issues and enable easier contributions from outside the SECoP
core Team.

The goal is to have a standard path through which larger changes are introduced
into the specification of SECoP.  Bugfixes, reformatting, and changes of a
similar scope, which do not change the semantics of the protocol, do not have to
follow this process.

The RFC process orients itself after proven similar processes, for example in
the Rust and Python communities. It is intended to be lightweight, but still
provide a frame to handle suggestions in a structured manner.


The Process
===========

Here we will lay out the steps to follow to change the specification.

- If you do not have a concrete idea, come talk to us to flesh it out.
- Copy the RFC-000-template.rst file and fill in the details. You can add
  sections freely, but try to fill out all the provided ones.
- take the next free number and add it to the template file.
- The RFC gets discussed - this should mostly happen under the rfc-pull
  request. If not, please add a summary if possible. Optimally, an
  implementation will already be done at this stage in one or more of the
  SECoP implementations in order to uncover possible problems.
- There may be irreconcilable problems with the RFC, in that case, the
  committee can decide to reject the RFC. In that case it may not be
  reopened. If there are new developments, or a new approach, a new RFC
  should be opened.
- If the RFC is in a satisfactory state, any of the SECoP committee members
  can propose to move to the finalization period. This is a limited time
  of one month. The RFC is broadcasted on the appropriate channels to notify
  people of the last chance to comment. If there are blocking issues
  uncovered in this period, it moves back to being under development.
  If no major issues crop up during the month, the RFC is accepted.


If you never used GitHub/Need Help
==================================

The process involving GitHub is mostly intended for the core team, if you e.g.
don't know how to use it, but have an awesome idea for SECoP, just make your
proposal using the template and contact us at EMAIL-HERE.
One of the core team will get back to you to help you with this process.
