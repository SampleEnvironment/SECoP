SECoP Issue 26: More Module Meanings (closed)
=============================================

Proposed new meanings: rotation_x, rotation_y, translation_x, translation_y, translation_z

Some problem is, that the exact meaning might differ.

:note: We may also just adapt to the ESS-definition: z is upwards, x along the beam-path, y follows from right-hand-rule.

As a general rule, we might say that '_regulation' can be postfixed to any menaing, if the quantity generating module is different from the (closer to the sample) relevant measuring device.
