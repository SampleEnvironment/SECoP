SECoP Issue 40: Finalise Specification (proposed)
=================================================

Motivation
----------
The current specification looks a lot like a placeholder with lots of pointers to Issues.
Also many things are only tried to clarify by inserting *note* and *remark* snippets.

Proposal
--------
Finalise the specification by replacing all *note* snippets with a definition.
As long as clarifying *note* and *remark* snippets are needed, its not yet a specification.

Discussion
----------
No decisions or detailed discussions so far.
