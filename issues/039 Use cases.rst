SECoP Issue 39: Use cases (proposed)
====================================

Motivation
-----------
In the current specification the reasoning behind several decisions is difficult to explain.
A collection of the covered use cases and "what to do if's" may help substantially.

This issue is supposed to collect these. They will NOT be part of the specification.

The format resembles that of a FAQ (frequently asked questions).

Use cases: setups (of ECS + SEC-Node(s))
----------------------------------------

Single, simple Request-Reply ECS:
  Use a single connection and just stick to the request-reply pattern.

Adding a Monitoring program:
  That should use a second connection and use only updates, i.e. never send change or do messages
  and as soon as possible enable updates after opening the connection.
  Selection of values and how to display them should be stored in a configfile for that monitoring program,
  they are not supposed to be contained in the descriptive data.

Event based ECS:
  recommended: use two connections: one for playing request-reply (change, do) and the second for
  receiving events.

  Or use two connections per module: one for request/reply and one for updates (NICOS2 does this btw.).

What if my SEC-node is a PLC via RS232:
  You can have only one connection via RS232. Unless you use a multiplexer.
  ``FRAPPY`` will contain a multiplexer for such cases.

What if my setup contains several SECoP enabled 'subnodes', but I want to make one SEC-Node:
   use frappy and set up your node using transparent clients to the other SEC-nodes.
   if needed, put filters inbetween to restrict allowed interactions.
   This may also work (soon) with the HZB dll.

   Or write an Issue to nest the structure report in a json-array, so that the presenting secnode may just include the descriptive data of all its sub-SEC-nodes.
   In that case the presenting SEC-node may be rather simple as it just 'relays' the messages to/from the appropriate sub-SEC-nodes.
   ``FRAPPY`` may contain such a message router in the future, but that is not top priority.


Use cases: Implementing SEC-Nodes
---------------------------------

simple single threaded SEC-node via RS232 (microcontroller based?):
  difficult to get right. You MUST NOT keep the communication quiet for too long.
  best approach is a state-machine driven mainloop and everything else is attached to interrupts.
  This keeps reaction time short, however the complexity of this should never be neglected.
  USE A BIG ENOUGH INPUT BUFFER! and expect long development time until it runs smooth.

SEC-node on a microcontroller but with network support:
  see above. Just a tad harder because of the network stuff. also less predictable.
  use a well tested network-stack! best is still: use a more powerful empedded system.
  microcontrollers are good for selected stuff, a full-blown SEC-node isn't amongst this.
  (i.e. it may still work, but the work-to-invest/power-it-can-deliver ratio you can achieve is not good)

If we have an operating system:
  much better. if the CPU is not from the stone-age, use a python framework to get
  quick results (like **FRAPPY**). Also, the OS handles all the multiple network connections for you,
  so let it do that!

multiple network connections are easy:
  Yes! So support them wherever possible.

But I can't implement multiple network connections:
  use frappy as a multiplexer and make your implementation FAST!

  *note:* you should really deliver something which can handle mutliple network connections!

Discussion
----------
No discussion of this issue in its current form yet.
Several parts were used in meetings as basis for decision-making.
