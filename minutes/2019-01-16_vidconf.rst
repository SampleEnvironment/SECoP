SECoP Issue 37: Clarification of status
---------------------------------------
* Lutz proposes that ECS should treat state codes which are not defined (i.e. outside of 100-599) should be treated as UNKNOWN.
  These codes should be treated like an ERROR (from the 4xx error group).
* Enrico proposed to define UNKNOWN as code 0.
* Klaus likes DISABLED to be 0, no UNKNOWN code, an ERROR should be used.
* Markus agrees essentially, but likes to use 401 for UNKNOWN.

Agreement on:

* statuscode for DISABLED is 0, UNKNWON is 401
* stauscodes 1-99 are RESEVED and MUST NOT be used, if they are seen, they are to be interpreted like DISABLED.

-------------------------------
