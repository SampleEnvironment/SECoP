6) Final session
================

Vincent Hardion joins for a short discussion about the NICOS-SECoP-Integration
and the comparison in module hierarchy.

The problem of trying to fit all SE information through EPICS is discussed.

Operando4NeXus
--------------

Klaus gives a short overview about Operando4NeXus, the successor to SECoP@HMC.
Its intended to expand the capabilities of NeXus for storing sample environment
and make it more flexible. In the HMC project, we produced something good on
the SECoP side, now we have to see to bring this into NeXus.
Need something flexible on the SE side without having static Application
Definitions for each SE.

Date for Next Online meeting
----------------------------

Since we want to invite people from ILL, we can't fix a date yet. A noodle will
be sent around by Markus.
