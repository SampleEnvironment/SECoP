Overview
========

This section will give an overview over the different parts of SECoP described in the different chapters of the specification.
As this specification is written bottom-up, and not everyone might need the details from every chapter, this part is intended to make the reader familiar with the basic concepts needed for understanding each chapter on its own.

We will start with the structural concept for the SECoP-server, move on to the messages and in the end learn what the description is for a SECoP-server and which datatypes are supported.


SECoP Node Structure
--------------------

SECoP is a communication protocol with a client-server model.
The server is called the 'SEC node'.

Each SEC node consists of one or more :ref:`Modules`.
These represent the main interface for interacting with the hardware.
Each of these modules can have static values which are known at startup and dynamic values.
These are called :ref:`properties` and :ref:`parameters <accessibles>` respectively.
Parameters can in turn have their own Properties.
Examples of properties would be the datatype of the Parameter or the :ref:`readonly <prop-readonly>` flag that shows whether a parameter may be written to or not.
To initiate actions that may not necessarily be tied to a parameter, modules can also have `Commands`, like stopping the current movement or running a calibration.
To give show which capabilities a Module supports, there are :ref:`interface-classes` and :ref:`features`.
The four interface classes currently existing are :ref:`Communicator <Communicator>`, which is intended for bare request-response communication, and three that represent values that can be interacted with: :ref:`Readable <Readable>`, :ref:`Writable <Writable>` and :ref:`Drivable <Drivable>`.
Readable modules have a main ``value`` and a ``status``, which shows the current error state of the module.
As the name implies, their main value can only be read.
Writable and Drivable modules allow to influence their value by writing to a ``target`` parameter.
Writables are intended for fast operations like switches, where the target state can be reached quickly (i.e. sub-second operations or similar).
Drivables funcion similar, but they can take longer to reach the target state.
Think of a motor that has to drive to a position along a rail.
For this, they would reflect the operation being ongoing in their status, setting it to ``BUSY`` and returning to ``IDLE`` once the operation is complete.

While this structure is one of the advantages of SECoP, the communication itself is build upon several :ref:`messages <messages>` which are transferred between SEC node and client.

Messages
--------

As an first look, we will see the general message structure, and the messages :ref:`*IND? <message-identification>`, :ref:`describe <message-describe>`, :ref:`read <message-read>`, and :ref:`change <message-change>`.
For an overview of all available messages, including calling commands and remote logging, etc., see :ref:`messages`.

There are three parts a message can have: ``action``, ``identifier`` and ``data``. Of these, depending on the action, ``identifier`` and ``data`` may not be needed.
The first part, ``action``, specifies the kind of message we want to send.
The middle part, ``identifier``, points to the module/parameter/property or command we want to operate on.
Finally, ``data`` is the data that may be needed for the specified action, like the new value when writing to a parameter, or the argument of a command.

The default mode for communicating between SEC node and client is a classic request-response mode, where the client initiates an exchange.
However, if the SEC node implementation supports it, the client may choose to move to the asynchronous mode, where the SEC node will send updates asynchronously when they occur. For more details on this, see the :ref:`activate <message-activate>` message.

As an example, writing the ``target`` parameter of a module we will name ``Temp``:

    change Temp:target 11.5

This will change the target parameter to the value 11.5, if possible.

For an example of a message, where one or more of the components is optional, lets have a look at the :ref:`describe <message-describe>` message:

    describe

As you can see, this message only needs the ``action`` part.

This brings us to the topic of the self-description of SECoP.

Description
-----------

The description is a formalized structure containing all information about the SEC nodes modules and their parameters, properties and commands.
It is machine readable, with all details about modules, parameters, datatypes and so on included.
Additionally, the implementor of the SEC node has to include textual descriptions for the important parts of the SEC node.
These short documentation texts are not intended for machines, but for the human operators of the equipment.
Functional dependencies that have to be machine readable are exposed through the already mentioned :ref:`interface-classes` and :ref:`features`.

For the representation details, see the section :ref:`descriptive-data-format`.

Datatypes
---------

A variety of datatypes are covered in SECoP:

There are simple datatypes, for example:
- :ref:`Integer <int>`
- :ref:`Scaled Integer <scaled>`
- :ref:`Floating Point <double>`
- :ref:`Boolean <bool>`
- :ref:`Enum <enum>`
- :ref:`String <string>`
- :ref:`Blob <blob>`

For more complicated values, there are three structured datatypes: :ref:`Array <array>`, :ref:`Tuple <tuple>`, and :ref:`Struct <struct>`.


``ArrayOf`` is an array of uniform values, ``TupleOf`` a fixed sequence of items that can be of non-uniform types, and ``StructOf``, a collection of named members, each of which can have their own types.

Note, that there is as of this writing no `None`-value or "optional" datatype that can be transported over SECoP.
