Introduction
============

The main goal of the "committee for the standardization of sample
environment communication" is to establish a common standard protocol
SECoP for interfacing sample environment equipment to experiment control
software.

Definition: Experiment Control Software ECS
     Software controlling the hardware for carrying out an experiment.
     Includes the user interface. Usually speaks several protocols with
     different parts of the instrument.
     Often also called short instrument control.

There is a task (7.1) within the European framework SINE2020 also
dealing with this subject. In its description we read:

    ... The standard should be defined in a way that it is compatible
    with a broad variety of soft- and hardware operated at the different
    large scale facilities. â€¦ The adoption of this standard will greatly
    facilitate the installation of new equipment and the share of
    equipment between the facilities. ...

This does also cover the aims of the committee.

The idea is, that a sample environment apparatus can easily be moved
between facilities and instruments/beamlines. As long as the facilities
have implemented a SECoP client within its ECS, and on the apparatus a
SECoP server is implemented as the SEC node, using the apparatus for an
experiment should be straightforward. An ECS can be built in a way, that
the configuration of a SEC node may be as short as entering a network
address, as the description can be loaded over the protocol.

Definition: Sample Environment Control Node (SEC node)
    Computing unit or process or task, connected to all control units (temperature controller,
    flow controller, pressure sensor ...) of a sample environment, bridge to the ECS.
    SECoP specifies how ECS speaks with the SEC node.
    The SEC node allows the ECS to access a set of modules (and their parameters/commands) via the SECoP.
    It also provides a list of accessible modules and parameters as well as descriptive meta data.

Other requirements
------------------

-  the protocol should be easy to use

-  it should be easy to implement in connection with existing ECSs and
   sample environment control software

-  it should be possible to be implemented on the most common platforms
   (operating systems and programming languages)

-  the protocol should be defined in way that allows a maximum
   **compatibility**: Newer and older versions of the syntax should
   be compatible

-  the protocol should be defined in a way, which allows a maximum
   **flexibility**: A simple (= with minimal features) ECS
   implementation should be able to communicate with a complex SEC
   node (with a lot of features), and an ECS with a rich number of
   features should be able to cope with a simple SEC node,
   implementing only a minimum number of features/functionality
