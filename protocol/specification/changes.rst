Changes between versions
========================

This document tracks the various additions and breaking changes made in the
different versions of the SECoP specification.

Minor version updates like 1.0 â†’ 1.1 only contain backwards compatible changes,
while major version updates can contain breaking changes.

A SEC node typically only implements one version of the specification.  To
maximize compatibility, all clients should strive to support all existing major
versions.


Version 2.0
-----------

This version is in the process of being finalized.

.. rubric:: Breaking changes

These changes make a 2.0 client necessary to connect to a 2.0 node without major
loss of functionality.

- The format of the `*IDN?` reply has been slightly changed and the meaning of
  the third field is now clarified.

- The `visibility` property for modules and accessibles has a new format with
  extended possibilities (:issue:`079 hints for readonly access`).

- The `meaning` property for modules has a different format with capabilities to
  link to external definitions/ontologies.  `meaning` can now also be given for
  individual accessibles, and new "functions" have been added.

.. TODO not yet in the text!

    - All :ref:`Struct <struct>` members can now be made optional by specifying
      ``"optional": true`` in the datainfo (:issue:`069 optional structs by
      default`).

.. rubric:: Backwards compatible changes

.. TODO machine readable, systems

- The specification text has been generally restructured and edited to improve
  clarity and presentation.

- The optional `check`/`checked` messages have been added, as well as the
  `checkable` accessible property (:issue:`075 New messages check and checked`).

- The :ref:`matrix <matrix>` data type has been specified for datainfo.

.. TODO

    - The `AcquisitionController`, `AcquisitionChannel` and `Acquisition` interface
      classes have been specified (:ref:`rfc-006`).

- The UDP discovery protocol has been specified (:ref:`rfc-005`).

- Optional SECoP transport over WebSockets has been specified (:ref:`rfc-007`).

<https://github.com/SampleEnvironment/SECoP/blob/master/protocol/SECoP_Specification_V1.1.rst>`_.

- The `~mod.implementation` property of modules has been added (:issue:`061 new
  predefined property implementation`).

- The `controlled_by` and `control_active` optional parameters have been
  specified, as well as the `control_off` command (:issue:`065 handling of
  coupled modules`).

- Features have been defined as a type of base class, and the `~mod.features`
  module property has been added (:issue:`072 features`).

- The `target_limits` parameter has been specified (:issue:`073 HasLimits and
  HasOffset`).

- The `HasOffset` feature and the `offset` parameter have been specified
