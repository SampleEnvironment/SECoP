Modules
=======

Definition: Module
    One logical component of an abstract view of the sample environment. Can at least be read.
    May be â€™driven' (set new setpoint). May have parameters influencing how it achieves
    its function (e.g. PID parameters). May have some additional diagnostics (read-only) parameters.
    May provide some additional status information (temperature stable?, setpoint reached?)
    Reading a module returns the result of the corresponding physical measurement.

We intentionally avoid the term "device", which might
be misleading, as "device" is often used for an entire apparatus, like a
cryomagnet or humidity cell. In the context of SECoP, an apparatus in
general is composed of several modules. For example different
temperature sensors in one apparatus are to be seen as different modules.

An SEC node controls a set of named modules. Modules also have
some descriptive data (type, list-of-parameters, list-of-commands, ...).

.. _accessibles:

Accessibles
-----------

A module has several accessibles associated with it. An accessible is
addressed by the combination of module and accessible name. Module names
have to be unique within an SEC node, accessible names have to be unique
within a module. There are two basic types of accessibles: parameters and commands.

Module and accessible names should be in English (incl. acronyms), using
only ASCII letters + digits and some additional characters (see :ref:`messagefmt`).
The maximum name length is 63 characters.

Parameter:
    The main parameter of a module is its value. Writable parameters may influence the
    measurement (like PIDs). Additional parameters may give more information about its
    state (running, target reached), or details about its functioning (heater power) for
    diagnostics purposes. Parameters with a predefined meaning are listed in the standard,
    they must always be used in the same way. Custom parameters are defined by the
    implementation of the SEC node, the ECS can use them only in a general way, as their
    meaning is not known.

Command:
    Commands are provided to initiate specified actions of the module.
    They should generate an appropriate reply immediately after that action is initiated,
    i.e. should not wait until some other state is reached.
    However, if the command triggers side-effects, they MUST be communicated before the reply is sent.
    Commands may use an possibly structured argument and may return a possibly structured result.
    Commands with a predefined meaning are listed in the standard,
    they must always be used in the same way. Custom commands are defined by the implementation of
    the SEC node, the ECS can use them only in a general way, as their meaning is not known.

The following section describes the currently predefined accessibles, this list will
be extended continuously.


Basic Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

parameter ``"value"``:
    a parameter representing the *main* value of a readable module.

.. _BUSY:

parameter ``"status"``:
    (a :ref:`tuple` of two elements: a status with predefined values
    from an :ref:`enum` as "IDLE","BUSY","ERROR", and a describing text).

    .. table:: assignment of status code groups

         ============ ============== =========================================
          statuscode   variant name   Meaning
         ============ ============== =========================================
            0           DISABLED      Module is not enabled
          1YZ           IDLE          Module is not performing any action
          2YZ           WARN          The same as IDLE, but something may not be alright, though it is not a problem (yet)
          3YZ           BUSY          Module is performing some action
          4YZ           ERROR         Module is in an error state, something turned out to be a problem.
         ============ ============== =========================================

    where YZ might be any combination of digits, in simple cases typically 00.

parameter ``"pollinterval"``:
    a hint to the module for the polling interval in seconds, type is always a :ref:`double`.

parameter ``"target"``:
    present, if the modules main value is to be changeable remotely, i.e. it is at least a Writable

command ``"stop"``:
     mandatory command on a drivable.
     When a modules target is changed (or, if present, when the ``go`` command is sent),
     it is 'driving' to a new value until the target is reached or until its stop command
     is sent.
     When the ``stop`` command is sent, the SEC node SHOULD set the target parameter
     to a value close to the present one. Then it SHOULD act as if this value would have
     been the initial target.

command ``"go"``:
     optional command for starting an action. If the ``go`` command is present,
     changing any parameter (especially the 'target' parameter) does not yet initiate any
     action leading to a BUSY state.
     In contrast, if no 'go' command is present, changing the target will start an action
     trying to change the value to get closer to the target, which usually leads to a BUSY
     state. Changing any parameter, which has an impact on measured values, should
     be executed immediately.


Ramping
~~~~~~~

parameter ``"ramp"``:
    (writable parameter, desired ramp. Units: main units/min)

parameter ``"setpoint"``:
    (ramping setpoint, read only)

parameter ``"time_to_target"``:
    (read only :ref:`double`, expected time to reach target in seconds)


Modes
~~~~~

parameter ``"mode"``:
    A parameter of datatype :ref:`enum`, for selecting the operation mode of a module.
    The available operation modes can not be predefined in the specification, since
    they depend on the specific module.

    Maximum set of allowed modes:

    .. code::

        {"type": "enum", "members": {"DISABLED": 0, "STANDBY": 30, "PREPARED": 50}}


additional codes for parameter ``"status"``:
    The meaning of the operation modes SHOULD be described in the description.

           X4Z         Preparing     intermediate state: Standby -> **Preparing** -> Prepared
           X5Z         Prepared      Ready for immediate target change
           X6Z         Starting      Target has changed, but continuous change has not yet started
           X7Z         Ramping       Continuous change, which might be used for measuring
           X8Z         Stabilizing   Continuous change has ended, but target value is not yet reached
           X9Z         Finalizing    Value has reached the target and any leftover cleanup operation
                                     is in progress. If the ECS is waiting for the value of this module
                                     being stable at target, it can continue.

         ====== ================ ========== ============== =========================================

    For the SEC node, it is recommended to use above names (second column) for the status :ref:`enum` type.
    For the ECS, the codes (and not the names) of the status :ref:`enum` are relevant for the meaning.

    The distinction between the status value 360 - 380 is important, if during a target change
    there is a period, where the value changes in a continuous way and measurements might be
    useful. If there is no such period, for example because the value performs some damped oscillation
    from the beginning of the movement, generic BUSY or STABILIZING should be used instead.

    Any undefined status code has to be treated like a generic subcode of the given code number,
    i.e. 376 should be treated as a BUSY_Ramping until it is defined otherwise in the specification.

    :related issues:
        `SECoP Issue 37: Clarification of status <https://github.com/SampleEnvironment/SECoP/blob/master/protocol/issues/037 Clarification of status.rst>`
        `SECoP Issue 59: set_mode and mode instead of some commands <https://github.com/SampleEnvironment/SECoP/blob/master/protocol/issues/059 set_mode and mode instead of some commands.rst>`
    :Note:
        the behavior of a module in each of the predefined states is not yet 100% defined.

    :Note:
        a module only need to declare the status values which it implements. i.e. an Readable module
        does not need a BUSY status.

    The interplay between the ``mode`` parameter and the status codes can be visualized
    in the following graph:

.. image:: images/status_diagram.svg

command ``"hold"``:
     optional command on a drivable. Stay more or less where you are, cease
     movement, be ready to continue soon, target value is kept. Continuation can be
     trigger with ``go``, or if not present, by putting the target parameter to its
     present value.

command ``"shutdown"``
     optional command for shutting down the hardware.
     When this command is sent, and the status is DISABLED,
     it is safe to switch off the related device.

:Note:
    Going to the DISABLED state, may also be triggered by changing the mode to DISABLED.
    If the implementor for security reason wants to prohibit any action after a shutdown,
    this should only be achieved by a shutdown command, as disabling the module should be
    reversible.



Error handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

command ``"reset"``
     optional command for putting the module to a state predefined by the implementation.

command ``"clear_errors"``:
     This command tries to clear an error state. It may be called when status is ERROR,
     and the command will try to transform status to IDLE or WARN. If it can not
     do it, the status should not change or change to an other ERROR state before
     returning ``done <module>:clear_errors``


Coupled Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

parameter ``"controlled_by"``:
   The control mechanism of a module might be coupled to another module (both modules are Drivable or Writable).
   This coupling is indicated by the ``controlled_by`` parameter (readonly).
   The datatype of the ``controlled_by`` parameter must be an :ref:`enum`, with the names being
   module names or ``self``. The :ref:`enum` value of ``self`` must be 0.
   A module with a ``controlled_by`` parameter indicates, that it may be controlled
   by one of the named modules.

   This coupling of two modules influences in particular the behavior of the parameters ``target`` and ``value``.
   For example a module B (e.g. representing the power output of a temperature controller) might be
   controlled by an other module A (e.g. the temperature module related to the same temperature controller),
   linking the behavior of the ``value`` parameter of module B to the ``target`` of the module A.

   The coupling to the ``target`` parameter of module B can be realized in two ways:

   1) Module A is (constantly) altering the ``target`` parameter of module B.

   2) The ``target`` parameter of module B is not updated and the functional control
      of the ``target`` parameter of module B is switched off.

   Any coupling of this kind must be signaled by the ``control_active`` parameter (see next section).

   Taking over control by a module is done by changing the ``target`` parameter or sending a ``go`` command to a module.
   I.e. module A takes over control when a ``target`` change or a ``go`` command is sent to the module A. In this case, before sending the reply,
   the ``controlled_by`` parameter of the module B must be set to the controlling module A.
   However, when the ``target`` change or a ``go`` command is sent to module B, the control
   switches over to module B and the ``controlled_by`` parameter of module B has to be set to ``self``.
   Please notice that in addition, the ``control_active`` parameters of module A and module B have
   to be set correctly (see next section) before sending the reply to a ``target``
   change or a ``go`` command as stated before.

   :remark: In case a module A controls several other modules, e.g. a temperature module of a liquid helium cryostat
            controlling the power output (module B) and the helium pressure for cooling (module C), additional parameters
            may be needed for selecting the control mode of module A. See for example the parameter
            ``"_automatic_nv_pressure_mode"`` in the example of a liquid helium cooled cryostat.

parameter ``"control_active"``:
   A readonly flag indicating whether a drivable or writable module is currently actively controlling.
   On a drivable without ``control_active`` parameter or with
   ``control_active`` =true, the system is trying to bring the ``value`` parameter to the ``target`` value.
   When ``control_active`` =false, this control mechanism is switched off, and the ``target`` value
   is not considered any more.
   In a typical example we have a module A controlling module B (e.g. temperature (A) and power output (B) as stated above) and with two possible
   states, as in the following example:

   =================== ====================== ======================
    state               module A               module B
   =================== ====================== ======================
    A controlling B     control_active=true    controlled_by="A",
                                               control_active=false
    B self controlled   control_active=false   controlled_by="self",
                                               control_active=true
   =================== ====================== ======================

   In another example we have two Writable modules (for example 'I' and 'V' in a power supply),
   which depend on each other in a system where not both may be active at the same time.

   =================== ====================== ======================
    state               module I               module V
   =================== ====================== ======================
    constant current    controlled_by="self",  controlled_by="I",
                        control_active=true    control_active=false
    constant voltage    controlled_by="V",     controlled_by="self",
                        control_active=false   control_active=true
   =================== ====================== ======================

   The module with ``control_active`` =false acts like a Readable, its ``target`` parameter is
   ignored. Changing the ``target`` value of the latter would switch control from one module
   to the other, toggling the ``control_active`` parameter of both modules.

command ``"control_off"``:
   A command to turn off active control (i.e setting the parameter ``control_active`` to false).
   This command is needed for turning off control,
   when there is no controlled module, e.g. when there is no heater module for a temperature
   loop, or when the heater module is not a Writable.

   In a more general way, ``"control_off"`` puts the module into an 'energy saving state',
   switching off active heating and cooling for a temperature loop or in case of a motor
   switching current off.

   Setting the target of a module always turns on active control. It is explicitly allowed
   for a module to have a ``"control_off"`` command when a controlled module is available
   (i.e. a module with a ``"controlled_by"`` parameter with the name of the controlling module).


Limits and Offset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

parameter ``"target_limits"``:
    In addition to the range given in the ``datainfo`` property of the ``target`` parameter,
    a SEC-Node might offer changeable limits restricting the allowed range even more.
    ``target_limits`` is structured as a :ref:`tuple` with two numeric members indicating
    the lower and upper end of a valid interval for the setting of the ``target`` parameter.
    The ``datainfo`` property of the ``target`` parameter must match the members of the
    ``datainfo`` property of ``target_limits``.
    The SEC node must reply with an error in case a given target value does not fit
    into the interval.

.. _offset:

parameter ``"offset"``:
    A storage for an offset to be applied when converting SECoP values to ECS values.
    See feature `HasOffset`_.


Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

command ``"communicate"``:
     Used for direct communication with hardware, with proprietary commands. It is useful
     for debugging purposes, or if the implementor wants to give access to parameters not
     supported by the driver. The datatype might be :ref:`string`, or any other datatype suitable
     to the protocol of the device. The ``communicate`` command  is meant to be used in
     modules with the ``Communicator`` interface class.


.. _properties:

Properties
----------

Definition: Properties
    The static information about parameters, modules and SEC nodes is
    constructed from properties with predefined names and meanings.

For a list of pre-defined properties see :ref:`descriptive-data`.

.. _prop-data-report:

Data report
-----------
A JSON array with the value of a parameter as its first element,
and an JSON object containing the Qualifiers_ for this value as its second element.

See also: :ref:`data-report`_.

:Remark:

    future revisions may append additional elements.
    These are to be ignored for implementations of the current specification

.. _error-report:

Error report
------------
An error report is used in a :ref:ref::`error-reply` indicating that the requested action could
not be performed as request or that other problems occurred.
The error report is a JSON-array containing the name of one of the :ref:`Error classes <error-classes>`, a human readable string
and as a third element a JSON-object containing extra error information,
which may include the timestamp (as key "t") and possible additional
implementation specific information about the error (stack dump etc.).

See also: `error-report`_.

.. _structure-report:

Structure report
----------------
The structure report is a structured JSON construct describing the structure of the SEC node.
This includes the SEC-node properties, the modules, their module-properties and accessibles
and the properties of the accessibles.
For details see :ref:`descriptive-data`.

.. _value:

Value
-----
Values are transferred as a JSON-Value.

.. admonition:: Programming Hint

    Some JSON libraries do not allow all JSON values in their (de-)serialization functions.
    Whether or not a JSON value is a valid JSON text, is controversial,
    see this `stackoverflow issue <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19569221>`_
    and :rfc:`8259`.

    (clarification: a *JSON document* is either a *JSON object* or a *JSON array*,
    a *JSON value* is any of a *JSON object*, *JSON array*, *JSON number* or *JSON string*.)

    If an implementation uses a library, which can not (de-)serialize all JSON values,
    the implementation can add angular brackets around a JSON value, decode it
    and take the first element of the result. When encoding the reverse action might be
    used as a workaround. See also :RFC:`7493`

.. _qualifiers:

Qualifiers
----------

Qualifiers optionally augment the value in a reply from the SEC node,
and present variable information about that parameter.
They are collected as named values in a JSON-object.

Currently 2 qualifiers are defined:

``"t"``:
    The timestamp when the parameter has changed or was verified/measured (when no timestamp
    is given, the ECS may use the arrival time of the update message as the timestamp).
    It SHOULD be given, if the SEC node has a synchronized time,
    the format is that of a UNIX time stamp, i.e. seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00Z,
    represented as a number, in general a floating point when the resolution
    is better than 1 second.

    :Note:
        To check if a SEC node supports time stamping, a `ping` request can be sent.
        (See also :ref:`message-heartbeat`).

``"e"``:
   the uncertainty of the quantity. MUST be in the same units
   as the value. So far the interpretation of "e" is not fixed.
   (sigma vs. RMS difference vs. ....)

other qualifiers might be added later to the standard.
If an unknown element is encountered, it is to be ignored.


.. _interface-classes:

Interface Classes
-----------------

The idea is, that the ECS can determine the functionality of a module
from its class.

The standard contains a list of classes, and a specification of the
functionality for each of them. The list might be extended over time.
Already specified base classes may be extended in later releases of the
specification, but earlier definitions will stay intact, i.e. no
removals or redefinitions will occur.

The module class is in fact a list of classes (highest level class
first) and is stored in the module-property `interface_classes`.
The ECS chooses the first class from the list which is known to it.
The last one in the list must be one of the base classes listed below.

:Remark:

    The list may also be empty, indicating that the module in question does not even conform to the Readable class!

Base classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _Communicator:

``"Communicator"``:
    The main purpose of the module is communication.
    It may have none of the predefined parameters of the other classes.

    The ``communicate`` command is used mainly for debugging reasons, or as a workaround
    for using hardware functionalities not implemented in the SEC node.

.. _Readable:

``"Readable"``:
    The main purpose is to represent readable values (i.e. from a Sensor).
    It has at least a ``value`` and a ``status`` parameter.

.. _Writable:

``"Writable"``:
    The main purpose is to represent fast settable values (i.e. a switch).
    It must have a ``target`` parameter in addition to what a `Readable`_ has.

.. _Drivable:

``"Drivable"``:
    The main purpose is to represent slow settable values (i.e. a temperature or a motorized needle valve).
    It must have a ``stop`` command in addition to what a `Writable`_ has.
    Also, the ``status`` parameter will indicate a `BUSY`_ state for a longer-lasting operations.

Features
~~~~~~~~

Features allow the ECS to detect if a SECoP module support a certain functionality.
A feature typically needs some predefined accessibles and/or module properties to be present.
However, it is not only a list of mandatory or optional accessibles, but
indicates to the ECS that it may handle this functionality in a specific way.

.. _HasOffset:

``"HasOffset"``:
    This feature is indicating that the ``value`` and ``target`` parameters of a module represent raw values, which
    need to be corrected by an offset. A module with the feature ``"HasOffset"`` must have
    a parameter ``offset``, which indicates to all clients that the transmitted raw values for the
    parameters ``value`` and ``target`` are to be converted to corrected values (at the client side)
    by the following formulas:

    For reading the parameters ``value`` and ``target``:

          corrected value (client) = value (transmitted) + offset

          corrected target (client) = target (transmitted) + offset

    For changing the parameter ``target``:

          target (transmitted) = corrected target (client) - offset

    mandatory parameter: offset_
