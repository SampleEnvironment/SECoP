Protocol layer
==============

This section specifies how SECoP servers and clients communicate with each
other, and how the protocol messages look when transferred over a connection
("on the wire").  This is mainly of interest for implementors of new clients
and/or servers, users of frameworks will find the :doc:`semantics` more
relevant.
