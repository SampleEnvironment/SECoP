Agenda topic: general remarks
-----------------------------

perception of SECoP seems suboptimal therefore we want to

 * create an forum on the ISSE webpage (+linking to the documentation)
 * update/rewrite the documentation first
 * provide a SHORT overview of SECoP (max 2 pages, no details)
 * provide a readonly copy of SECoP on github (or other PUBLIC site)

 * Eddy mentions some critisism (by others), that information about SECoP was difficult or not at all to be found.

.. todo::
    An new, short overview shall be created by HZB (i.e. Frank)


SECoP from our point of view:

   * self describing protocol to control hardware
   * flexible, modular
   * unifying the big number of existing, incompatible (proprietary) protocols, for which often not even an API is provided
   * provides an api
   * wants to achieve interoperability between facilities

.. todo::
    All committee members should be contributors to the SECoP github project


Agenda topic: discussion about issues
-------------------------------------

 * Markus created the Issues, everybody likes the approach
 * a discussion about the different ways to handle tickets/issues with redmone/github/in a repo ensures.
 * the discussion broadens about documentation/issue change tracking, rights for modification/merge

.. todo::
    result is: we try to use the github workflow for documentation (as wiki) and issues (as topics)

Agenda topic: HZB SECoP dll: current status
-------------------------------------------

 * programmatic creation of SEC-nodes via CreateNode, AddModule, AddParameter, AddCommand, AddProperty
 * finalise with NodeComplete (also enable access from outside)
 * builds a multithreaded server for each Node, each Module is handled by it's own thread
 * building keeps an internal state and should be singlethreaded!
 * Variant data type (with unit tests) implemented in a C compliant way
 * LabVIEW test case (calling the DLL from LabVIEW) working
 * view issues left: (note: still prototype!)
   * closedown with non-QT application sometimes crashes
   * validation not yet 100% complete
   * refactoring
 * live demo of a needle valve controller controlled by a small LabVIEW demo programm emebdding the dll, beeing controlled by a simple network client (entering secop protocol messages by hand)
 * accesscontrol can be done via multiple nodes exporting a (posible readonly) subset of modules/parameters

New problems found:
    1) not all json libraries accept plain json-values like '1.234', but only json-documents
    2) concentrate on the 'working' ones
    3) open an issue for this (for documenting this)
    4) a way out could be to jsonify the whole message, if we would ever need it
    5) Lutz found a (workaround) way to handle this:
        * while reading a SECoP value (JSON value), the code surrounds the value with brackets ('[' value ']'), reads it with its library and takes the first element
        * when writing a SECoP value, you generate a JSON array of one element, convert it with the JSON library to a string and remove the surrounding brackets.

.. todo::
   create an Issue to document this.

Discussion about access control:

 * currently SECoP itself does not provide access control (except read/write property)
 * we rely on existing network solutions (bind to local port, use SSL Server, use multiple 'view' nodes)
 * agreement, that access control is not part of SECoP

.. todo::
    open an closed issue documenting this discussion


Agenda Topic: Issues inside the playground-protocol-documentation
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 * overview of the current Issues

.. note::
    * a lengthy discussion about how to proceed ensures
    * followed by a discussion about delayed change/commit of parameters, changing multiple parameters 'at once'
    * discussing commons and differences between start, pause, continue and stop
    * discussion is postponed without result

.. todo::
    create an Issue for starting or synchronizing disjunct hw-modules (possible delegated to other SEC-Nodes)

.. todo::
    create an Issue to collect uses case for:
     * different kinds of HW (different parameter setting with respect to starting)

.. todo::
    create an Issue (to be discussed) for:
     * reading the (RO) target parameter gives you the HW value
     * if there is no start command available, writing to the (RW) wanted_target starts the action
       else you need to call start() after writing to wanted_target.
       In any case, the target parameter reflects the value used by the hw.

       Lutz thinks that looking at the status (and predefining a view values for it) may be sufficient and
       to have an additional parameter 'wanted_target' can be avoided.

Agenda Topic: discussion about the definition of pause/stop/start/shutdown
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. todo:: make an issue about the start/stop/pause/shutdown commands
       not all commands must always be implemented, but if they are implemented, they have a predefined meaning to it
       AND
       if somebody want to implement something with the predefined meaning, it must be with the predefined name

Agenda Topic: timestamps: mandatory or optional
-----------------------------------------------

 * providing timestamp is highly recommend, but stays optional
 * timestamps are (still) fractional unix time with a resolution of at least seconds
 * SEC-node implementor decides about implemented resolution

.. todo:: document this in an Issue

Agenda Topic: Interfaceclasses
------------------------------

 * discussion about custom vs. predefined parameters and properties
 * proposal to introduce 'features' in addition to base interface_class
 * features are listed by name in an additional module property called 'features'
 * explicit listing of 'features' seems better than guessing them from the existence of parameters
 * features have predefined 'dependencies', excludes, set of parameters with predefined meanings
 * Open question: how to figure out the difference of an unknown base class to a known base class?
 * Markus proposes to use just Features then.


.. todo:: create an Issue for documenting this and for discussing it later in more detail

Agenda Topic: discussing existing Issues
----------------------------------------

 1) Issues: agreement to use Issues for documenting, closed
 2) Equipment_id is stored as a node property and is no longer part of the describing reply: agreement, closed
 3) already closed
 4) default timeout: change default to 10s, agreement, closed
 5) name change: live properties -> qualifiers to avoid misunderstands: agreement, closed
 6) keep alive: leave as to be discussed
 7) time synchronisation: leave to be discussed
    SEC-Nodes have its correct timestamp (provided by other means), have their own invented time, or no timestamps at all.
    agreement: the kind of SEC-node clock shall be noted as node property in the descriptive data. (this part closed)
    to be discussed: name of the node property (proposal: clock, datatype: Enum(None=0, relative=1, absolute=2)
 8) groups+hierarchy: leave as to discussed
 9) meaning/importance: leave as to be discussed
 10) Names and upper/lowercase: names can be uppercased as long as the lowercase version is still unique. agreement, close
 11) giving only module name for read/update/event request are extended with :value or :target: agreement on not specifying this.
     Clients are not allowed to use it, servers may support it but it is non-standard behaviour.

.. todo:: Issue 11 is still coded as second part of Issue 10 -> split it (Markus)

.. todo:: create an Issue about providing a mean to set the SEC-nodes clock from the ECS side.

.. note:: Klaus and Eddy leaving at this point


Agenda Topic: Grouping/Hierachy (Issue 8)
-----------------------------------------

 * discussion about namespaces and use cases for groups
 * grouping is 'giving modules or parameters a name to allow guis to group them together'
 * the (lowercase) name of a (parameter)group is not allowed to clash with (lowercased) names of parameters of the same module
 * the (lowercase) name of a (module)group is not allowed to clash with (lowercased) names of modules of the same node
 * agreement, closing this issue


.. todo:: create an Issue for PID tables


Topic: handling of driver generated timestamps in the HZB-DLL
-------------------------------------------------------------

 1) initiate the timestamp with NAN before calling the HW-read_a_value callback, which may provide an timestamp
 2) if configured to do so, a NAN timestamp is replaced after the callback with the current time
 3) if the timestamp is still NAN (or not expressable by digits), it is NOT send

.. todo:: @Frank: document this !


Discussion about activate/deactivate
------------------------------------

 * normally values for all values are send before the activated reply is sent
 * there are very rare cases where a value can (not yet) be determined. In this case it is acceptable to send a null value.
 * a null value is also accepted when setting parameters of a complex datatype and not all members shall be updated.

.. todo:: create an issue about the usage of null

.. note:: tour around PSI

.. note:: presentation of the SEA and SICS concept by Markus Zolliker

.. note:: detailed showcase of the HZB-DLL source

.. note:: we need more use cases and sequencediagrams


29.11.2017
++++++++++

 * detailed presentation of the playground
 * discussion about implementation details
 * structure of config files
 * introduction to writing secop modules + how to configure them
 * live demo

 * fixing the amagnet
 * discussing error propagation (bugs in hw-driver)

.. note:: meeting was closed around 14:30
