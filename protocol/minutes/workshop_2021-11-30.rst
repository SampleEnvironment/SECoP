----------

Markus reports about two cases of equipment with SECoP moved to an other facility
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Uniaxial pressure stick, travelling from PSI to DESY.
Only SECoP is spoken between instrument control and control rack of the stick.
The pressure stick setup seems a good example for Issue 65.
Markus also explained some of the integration issues they had at DESY.

The second example was a power supply setup from FRMII to PSI.
Apart from minor issues caused by hardware issues and applying too much power to the sample stick,
the setup worked out-of-the box.

Issue 61: new predefined property `implementation`
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Markus found, that we already have a comparable SEC node property ``firmware``.
Only the new module property ``implementation`` will be introduced, but not
the new SEC node property, as its meaning would be the same as the already
existing ``firmware`` property.

agreement on Issue 61, close it.


Issue 67: pid control parameters
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Enno makes a connection between the set of pid-control parameters and the
line of an interpolation table (different issue...).
Discussion about using individual values vs. using a struct continues.
Enno and Klaus favour using a struct, Markus find using individual parameters easier.

Markus opens the point of use cases for non-optional structs.
(lets re-think this later)

Agreement on using a ``ctrlpars`` struct with all items optional.
Naming of the struct needs a re-think, ``p``, ``i`` and ``d`` are agreed names for p,i and d.
Names of (allowed) additional items are to be discussed.

Side-topic: specifying no ``optional`` part of a struct means *ALL* items are optional.
To have all items mandatory, specify an empty list.


Issue 66: force re-connect
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Agreement, Issue closed.


Issue 63 enumeration of floating point values
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Markus wants to have a link between enumeration entries and a numerical value for saving in data files.
Setting a numeric value, the secnode should handle non-listed values (rounding up or down).
A gui would continue to use the enumeration values.

This link can be done via a ``influences`` property, instead of adding extra ``values`` parameter.
Using two 'linked' parameters is agreed upon.

Side-topic: ``influences`` entries *may* contain a *SINGLE* colon (':')
to indicate 'module:parameter' style references to parameters of other modules.

time is running out. remaining topics are saved for tomorrow.

Timing and time synchronisation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Anders brought up the topic, on how modules figure out their timestamp time.
An Issue will be written and discussed later.


SECoP Issue 65: handling of coupled (sub)modules
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Markus presented some ideas about distributed control/coupling of modules.
Enno points out that you can't reliably couple modules of different (pre-configured)
sec-nodes.
Agreement on having an optional, read-only parameter ``controlled_by`` (on Drivables/Writables)
solves the issue, if all participants are defined within one secnode.
If that parameter is not an empty string, the module is to be treated like a Readable
module. Otherwise it must name a module of the same sec-node.

After discussing the consequences, an enum instead of a string is preferred, with a default value
of 0:'self' meaning the module is not controlled by some other module. Other values should
'name' the potential controllers of this module.


Issue 67: pid control parameters (part2)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Markus points out, that using structs has the disadvantage of loosing properties like 'readonly' and 'description'.
Klaus states that this happens with all structs, which still is no reason to avoid it.

All agree that the control parameters will be a struct.
In addition a new Issue will be written to add properties to struct items.
Another new Issue about changing a single element of an array or tuple is also needed.

related: Issue 20: PID tables

Issue 71: accessing sub items of parameters
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Discussion jump starts about how not to blow up the specification and what features
are actually required.
Key point of discussion is the question if accessing subitems is mandatory or optional.
Also if accessing subitems is better done with custom commands or as a feature of the protocol.
Agreement on having the `read`` and ``change`` requests/replies to support accessing
subitems with the proposed syntax. the reply should only refer to the request'ed value., i.e.
the change of a table cell will reply with tha changed cell only.
updates, however, only sent the full value.
An intense discussion about the last point takes place.

Agreement seems possible about sending sub-item updates after a change.
However, if a polling-triggered update is sent, it must be a full update.
Markus points out, that so far timestamps are defined for the parameter, and not individual
timestamps for the sub-items.

Discussion about sending updates due to side-effects and if they only contain the changed
elements, but are multiple updates, or if they send out the full parameter or just the
'structure-layer' containing all the changes.

SEC-node programmers should decide, what kind of updates they send out upon side-effects.
All clients just need to be informed about the changed data set, if this is done by sending
out the whole parameter, or by sending individual sub-item updates, is up to the sec-node
programmer.

Clarification: array lengths can ONLY be changed be resetting the full array and accessing
invalid/undefined array indices is always an error.
(**no** dynamic resize upon accessing previously undefined elements)

Markus re-raises the question if accessing the sub-elements of a tuple is allowed.
after short discussion, agreement on this as well is reached.


Issue 64: reading of multiple parameters simultaneously
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Markus raise the question of the use cases. Enno does not see the need.
Klaus states that, after having ``influences`` property, the issue needs to be re-thought.
Markus points out that bundling of information is already possible und should be used in
such cases. Enno figured out that data duplication could be avoid in many cases, as we
have access to individual elements on structured data types already.

Agreement on this: new SECoP rule:

- if multiple items need to be accessed simultaneously, put them into a structure data type.
- if a write triggers side-effects, use the ``influences`` property to point this out.


Issue 68: transaction of multiple commands
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

See above.


Issue 70 message is a JSON object
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

postponed until a new major version is to be released.


Issue 69: optional structs by default
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

reject as no longer needed. Solved by Issue 71.


next meeting
++++++++++++
