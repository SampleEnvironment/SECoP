NeXus: A common data format for neutron, X-ray and muon science.

         http://www.nexusformat.org/

NeXus is developed as an international standard by scientists 
and programmers representing major scientific facilities in 
Europe, Asia, Australia, and North America in order to facilitate 
greater cooperation in the analysis and visualization of neutron, 
X-ray, and muon data. 

This installer package contains:
* NeXus base class and instrument definitions in NXDL format
* NeXus documentation and examples, such as the user and reference manuals
