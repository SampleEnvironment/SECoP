**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a mesh of triangles. ...

      Computational geometry description of a mesh of triangles.

      The mesh may be self-intersecting and have holes but the
      triangles must not be degenerated.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
