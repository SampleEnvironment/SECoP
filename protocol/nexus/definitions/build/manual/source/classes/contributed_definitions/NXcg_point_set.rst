**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a set of points in Euclidean space. ...

      Computational geometry description of a set of points in Euclidean space.

      The relevant coordinate system should be referred to in the NXtransformations
      instance. Points may have an associated time value; however users are advised
      to store time data of point sets rather as instances of time events, where
      for each point in time there is an NXcg_point_set instance which specifies the
      points locations. This is a frequent situation in experiments and computer
      simulations, where positions of points are taken at the same point in time;
      and therefore an additional time array would demand to store redundant pieces
      of information for each point.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **d**: The dimensionality, which has to be at least 1.

  **c**: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of points.

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXcg_point_set/dimensionality-field:

  .. index:: dimensionality (field)

  **dimensionality**: (optional) :ref:`NX_POSINT <NX_POSINT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`} 


  .. _/NXcg_point_set/cardinality-field:

  .. index:: cardinality (field)

  **cardinality**: (optional) :ref:`NX_POSINT <NX_POSINT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`} 


  .. _/NXcg_point_set/identifier_offset-field:

  .. index:: identifier_offset (field)

  **identifier_offset**: (optional) :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`} 

    .. collapse:: Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing ...

        Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
        identifiers for points. Identifiers are defined either implicitly
        or explicitly. For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the
        interval [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
        For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be defined.

        The identifier_offset field can for example be used to communicate if the
        identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as Fortran-/Matlab-)
        or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index notation) respectively.

  .. _/NXcg_point_set/identifier-field:

  .. index:: identifier (field)

  **identifier**: (optional) :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [c]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`} 

    Integer used to distinguish points for explicit indexing.

  .. _/NXcg_point_set/position-field:

  .. index:: position (field)

  **position**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 2, Dimensions: [c, d]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_LENGTH <NX_LENGTH>`} 

    The array of point coordinates.

  .. _/NXcg_point_set/time-field:

  .. index:: time (field)

  **time**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [c]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_TIME <NX_TIME>`} 

    The optional array of time for each vertex.

  .. _/NXcg_point_set/TRANSFORMATIONS-group:

  **TRANSFORMATIONS**: (optional) :ref:`NXtransformations` 

    .. collapse:: Reference to or definition of a coordinate system with ...

        Reference to or definition of a coordinate system with
        which the positions and directions are interpretable.
