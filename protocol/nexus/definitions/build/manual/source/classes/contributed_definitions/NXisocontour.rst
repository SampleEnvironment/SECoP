**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of isocontouring/phase-fields in Euclidean sp ...

      Computational geometry description of isocontouring/phase-fields in Euclidean space.

      Iso-contouring algorithms such as MarchingCubes and others are frequently
      used to segment d-dimensional regions into regions where intensities are
      lower or higher than a threshold value, the so-called isovalue.

      Frequently in computational materials science phase-field methods are
      used which generate data on discretized grids. Isocontour algorithms
      are often used in such context to pinpoint the locations of microstructural
      features from this implicit phase-field-variable-based description.

      One of the key intentions of this base class is to provide a starting point
      for scientists from the phase-field community (condensed matter physicists,
      and materials engineers) to incentivize that also phase-field simulation
      data could be described with NeXus, provided base classes such as the this one
      get further extend according to the liking of the phase-field community.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **d**: The dimensionality of the description.
