      Spatial filter to filter entries within a region-of-interest based on their
      position.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **n_ellipsoids**: Number of ellipsoids.

  **n_hexahedra**: Number of hexahedra.

  **n_cylinders**: Number of cylinders.

    .. collapse:: Qualitative statement which specifies which spatial filtering with respective ...

        Qualitative statement which specifies which spatial filtering with respective
        geometric primitives or bitmask is used. These settings are possible:

        * entire_dataset, no filter is applied, the entire dataset is used.  
        * union_of_primitives, a filter with (rotated) geometric primitives.  
          All ions in or on the surface of the primitives are considered  
          while all other ions are ignored.  
        * bitmasked_points, a boolean array whose bits encode with 1  
          which ions should be included. Those ions whose bit is set to 0  
          will be excluded. Users of python can use the bitfield operations  
          of the numpy package to define such bitfields.

        Conditions:
        In the case that windowing_method is entire_dataset all entries are processed.
        In the case that windowing_method is union_of_primitives,
        it is possible to specify none or all types of primitives
        (ellipsoids, cylinder, hexahedra). If no primitives are specified
        the filter falls back to entire_dataset.
        In the case that windowing_method is bitmask, the bitmask has to be defined;
        otherwise the filter falls back to entire dataset.

        Any of these values: ``entire_dataset`` | ``union_of_primitives`` | ``bitmask``
