            Describes an environment setup for the experiment.

            All the setting values of the independently scanned controllers are listed under corresponding
            NXsensor groups. Similarly, seperate NXsensor groups are used to store the readings from each
            measurement sensor.

            For example, in a temperature-dependent IV measurement, the temperature and voltage must be 
            present as independently scanned controllers and the current sensor must also be present with
            its readings.

                For each point in the scan space, either the nominal setpoint of an independently scanned controller
                or a representative average value of a measurement sensor is registered.

                The length of each sensor's data value array stored in this group should be equal to the number of scan points
                probed in this scan. For every scan point [N], the corresponding sensor value can be picked from index [N].
                This allows the scan to be made in any order as the user describes above in the experiment. We get matching
                values simply using the index of the scan point.

                Timestamp for when the values provided in the value field were registered.

                Individual readings can be stored with their timestamps under value_log. This is to timestamp
                the nominal setpoint or average reading values listed above in the value field.
