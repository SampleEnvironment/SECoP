      State of a container holding the sample under investigation.

      A container is any object in the beam path which absorbs the beam and 
      whose contribution to the overall attenuation/scattering needs to be 
      determined to process the experimental data. Examples of containers 
      include glass capillary tubes, vanadium cans, windows in furnaces or 
      diamonds in a Diamond Anvil Cell. The following figures show a complex
      example of a container:

      .. figure:: container/ComplexExampleContainer.png

         A hypothetical capillary furnace. The beam passes from left to right
         (blue dashes), passing through window 1, then window 2, before 
         passing through the downstream wall of the capillary. It is then 
         scattered by the sample with scattered beams passing through the 
         upstream wall of the capillary, then windows 4 and 5. As part of the
         corrections for a PDF experiment it is necessary to subtract the PDF
         of the empty container (i.e. each of the windows and the capillary).
         To calculate the PDF of the empty container it is necessary to have 
         the measured scattering data and to know the nature (e.g. density, 
         elemental composition, etc.) of the portion of the container which 
         the beam passed through.

      .. figure:: container/ComplexContainerBeampath.png

         A complete description of the shapes of the container elements with 
         their orientation relative to the beam and also information on 
         whether they are upstream or downstream of the sample is also 
         therefore important. For example, although the windows 2 and 4 have 
         the same shape, the path taken through them by the beam is very 
         different and this needs to be modelled. Furthermore, it is not 
         inconceivable that windows might move during an experiment and thus 
         the changes to the beampath would need to be accounted for.

      This class encodes the position of the container with respect to the 
      sample and allows the calculation of the beampath through the container.
      It also includes sufficient data to model beam absorption of the 
      container and a link to a dataset containing a measurement of the 
      container with nothing inside, to allow data corrections (at a specific
      beam energy/measurement time) to be made.

        Specified using CIF conventions. Abbreviated version of CIF 
        standard:

        * Only recognized element symbols may be used.
        * Each element symbol is followed by a 'count' number. A count of 
          '1' may be omitted.
        * A space or parenthesis must separate each cluster of (element 
          symbol + count).
        * Where a group of elements is enclosed in parentheses, the 
          multiplier for the group must follow the closing parentheses. 
          That is, all element and group multipliers are assumed to be 
          printed as subscripted numbers.
        * Unless the elements are ordered in a manner that corresponds to 
          their chemical structure, the order of the elements within any 
          group or moiety depends on whether or not carbon is present.
        * If carbon is present, the order should be:

          - C, then H, then the other elements in alphabetical order of 
            their symbol. 
          - If carbon is not present, the elements are listed purely in 
            alphabetic order of their symbol.
