**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe a geometry. ...

      Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe a geometry.
      May also contain axes that do not move and therefore do not have a transformation
      type specified, but are useful in understanding coordinate frames within which
      transformations are done, or in documenting important directions, such as the
      direction of gravity.

      A nested sequence of transformations lists the translation and rotation steps
      needed to describe the position and orientation of any movable or fixed device.

      There will be one or more transformations (axes) defined by one or more fields
      for each transformation. Transformations can also be described by NXlog groups when
      the values change with time. The all-caps name ``AXISNAME`` designates the
      particular axis generating a transformation (e.g. a rotation axis or a translation
      axis or a general axis).   The attribute ``units="NX_TRANSFORMATION"`` designates the
      units will be appropriate to the ``transformation_type`` attribute:

      * ``NX_LENGTH`` for ``translation``
      * ``NX_ANGLE`` for ``rotation``
      * ``NX_UNITLESS`` for axes for which no transformation type is specified

      This class will usually contain all axes of a sample stage or goniometer or
      a detector.  The NeXus default McSTAS coordinate frame is assumed, but additional
      useful coordinate axes may be defined by using axes for which no transformation
      type has been specified.

      The entry point (``depends_on``) will be outside of this class and point to a
      field in here. Following the chain may also require following ``depends_on``
      links to transformations outside, for example to a common base table.  If
      a relative path is given, it is relative to the group enclosing the ``depends_on``
      specification.

      For a chain of three transformations, where :math:`T_1` depends on :math:`T_2`
      and that in turn depends on :math:`T_3`, the final transformation :math:`T_f` is

      .. math:: T_f = T_3 T_2 T_1

      In explicit terms, the transformations are a subset of affine transformations
      expressed as 4x4 matrices that act on homogeneous coordinates, :math:`w=(x,y,z,1)^T`.

      For rotation and translation,

      .. math:: T_r &= \begin{pmatrix} R & o \\ 0_3 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \\ T_t &= \begin{pmatrix} I_3  & t + o \\ 0_3 & 1 \end{pmatrix}

      where :math:`R` is the usual 3x3 rotation matrix, :math:`o` is an offset vector,
      :math:`0_3` is a row of 3 zeros, :math:`I_3` is the 3x3 identity matrix and
      :math:`t` is the translation vector.

      :math:`o` is given by the ``offset`` attribute, :math:`t` is given by the ``vector``
      attribute multiplied by the field value, and :math:`R` is defined as a rotation
      about an axis in the direction of ``vector``, of angle of the field value.

      NOTE

      One possible use of ``NXtransformations`` is to define the motors and
      transformations for a diffractometer (goniometer).  Such use is mentioned
      in the ``NXinstrument`` base class.  Use one ``NXtransformations`` group 
      for each diffractometer and name the group appropriate to the device.
      Collecting the motors of a sample table or xyz-stage in an NXtransformations
      group is equally possible.

      Following the section on the general dscription of axis in NXtransformations is a section which
      documents the fields commonly used within NeXus for positioning purposes and their meaning. Whenever
      there is a need for positioning a beam line component please use the existing names. Use as many fields
      as needed in order to position the component. Feel free to add more axis if required. In the description
      given below, only those atttributes which are defined through the name are spcified. Add the other attributes
      of the full set:

      * vector
      * offset
      * transformation_type
      * depends_on

      as needed.

  .. index:: default (file attribute)

  **@default**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>`

        .. index:: plotting

        Declares which child group contains a path leading 
        to a :ref:`NXdata` group.

        It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
        to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
        See https://www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
        for a summary of the discussion.

  .. _/NXtransformations/AXISNAME-field:

  .. index:: AXISNAME (field)

  **AXISNAME**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_TRANSFORMATION <NX_TRANSFORMATION>`}

        Units need to be appropriate for translation or rotation

        The name of this field is not forced.  The user is free to use any name
        that does not cause confusion.  When using more than one ``AXISNAME`` field,
        make sure that each field name is unique in the same group, as required
        by HDF5.

        The values given should be the start points of exposures for the corresponding
        frames.  The end points should be given in ``AXISNAME_end``.

    .. _/NXtransformations/AXISNAME@transformation_type-attribute:

    .. index:: transformation_type (field attribute)

    **@transformation_type**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

      .. collapse:: The transformation_type may be ``translation``, in which case the ...

          The transformation_type may be ``translation``, in which case the
          values are linear displacements along the axis, ``rotation``,
          in which case the values are angular rotations around the axis.

          If this attribute is omitted, this is an axis for which there
          is no motion to be specifies, such as the direction of gravity,
          or the direction to the source, or a basis vector of a
          coordinate frame. In this case the value of the ``AXISNAME`` field
          is not used and can be set to the number ``NaN``.

          Any of these values: ``translation`` | ``rotation``

    .. _/NXtransformations/AXISNAME@vector-attribute:

    .. index:: vector (field attribute)

    **@vector**: (required) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` 

      .. collapse:: Three values that define the axis for this transformation. ...

          Three values that define the axis for this transformation.
          The axis should be normalized to unit length, making it
          dimensionless.  For ``rotation`` axes, the direction should be
          chosen for a right-handed rotation with increasing angle.
          For ``translation`` axes the direction should be chosen for
          increasing displacement. For general axes, an appropriate direction
          should be chosen.

    .. _/NXtransformations/AXISNAME@offset-attribute:

    .. index:: offset (field attribute)

    **@offset**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` 

      .. collapse:: A fixed offset applied before the transformation (three vector components). ...

          A fixed offset applied before the transformation (three vector components).
          This is not intended to be a substitute for a fixed ``translation`` axis but, for example,
          as the mechanical offset from mounting the axis to its dependency.

    .. _/NXtransformations/AXISNAME@offset_units-attribute:

    .. index:: offset_units (field attribute)

    **@offset_units**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

      Units of the offset.  Values should be consistent with NX_LENGTH.

    .. _/NXtransformations/AXISNAME@depends_on-attribute:

    .. index:: depends_on (field attribute)

    **@depends_on**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

      .. collapse:: Points to the path to a field defining the axis on which this ...

          Points to the path to a field defining the axis on which this
          depends or the string ".".

    .. _/NXtransformations/AXISNAME@equipment_component-attribute:

    .. index:: equipment_component (field attribute)

    **@equipment_component**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

      .. collapse:: An arbitrary identifier of a component of the equipment to which ...

          An arbitrary identifier of a component of the equipment to which
          the transformation belongs, such as 'detector_arm' or 'detector_module'.
          NXtransformations with the same equipment_component label form a logical
          grouping which can be combined together into a single change-of-basis
          operation.

  .. _/NXtransformations/AXISNAME_end-field:

  .. index:: AXISNAME_end (field)

  **AXISNAME_end**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_TRANSFORMATION <NX_TRANSFORMATION>`} 

    .. collapse:: ``AXISNAME_end`` is a placeholder for a name constructed from the actual ...

        ``AXISNAME_end`` is a placeholder for a name constructed from the actual
        name of an axis to which ``_end`` has been appended.

        The values in this field are the end points of the motions that start
        at the corresponding positions given in the ``AXISNAME`` field.

  .. _/NXtransformations/AXISNAME_increment_set-field:

  .. index:: AXISNAME_increment_set (field)

  **AXISNAME_increment_set**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_TRANSFORMATION <NX_TRANSFORMATION>`} 

    .. collapse:: ``AXISNAME_increment_set`` is a placeholder for a name constructed from the ac ...

        ``AXISNAME_increment_set`` is a placeholder for a name constructed from the actual
        name of an axis to which ``_increment_set`` has been appended.

        The value of this optional field is the intended average range through which
        the corresponding axis moves during the exposure of a frame.  Ideally, the
        value of this field added to each value of ``AXISNAME`` would agree with the
        corresponding values of ``AXISNAME_end``, but there is a possibility of significant
        differences.  Use of ``AXISNAME_end`` is recommended.
