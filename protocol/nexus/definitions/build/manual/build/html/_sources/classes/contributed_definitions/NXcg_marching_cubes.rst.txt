===================

**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of the marching cubes algorithm. ...

      Computational geometry description of the marching cubes algorithm.

      Documenting which specific version was used can help to understand how robust
      the results are with respect to the topology of the triangulation.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

**Groups cited**:
  :ref:`NXcg_grid`

.. index:: NXcg_grid (base class); used in base class

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXcg_marching_cubes/implementation-field:

  .. index:: implementation (field)

  **implementation**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    .. collapse:: Reference to the specific implementation of marching cubes used. ...

        Reference to the specific implementation of marching cubes used.

        See for example the following papers for details about how to identify a
        DOI which specifies the implementation used:

        * `W. E. Lorensen <https://doi.org/10.1109/MCG.2020.2971284>`_  
        * `T. S. Newman and H. Yi <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2006.07.021>`_

        The value placed here should be a DOI. If there are no specific DOI or
        details write not_further_specified, or give at least a free-text
        description.

  .. _/NXcg_marching_cubes/program-field:

  .. index:: program (field)

  **program**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    Commercial or otherwise given name to the program which was used.

    .. _/NXcg_marching_cubes/program@version-attribute:

    .. index:: version (field attribute)

    **@version**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

      .. collapse:: Program version plus build number, commit hash, or description of ...

          Program version plus build number, commit hash, or description of
          an ever persistent resource where the source code of the program
          and build instructions can be found so that the program can be
          configured in such a manner that the result file is ideally
          recreatable yielding the same results.

  .. _/NXcg_marching_cubes/grid-group:

  **grid**: (optional) :ref:`NXcg_grid` 

    .. collapse:: Reference/link to and/or details of the grid on which a specific ...

        Reference/link to and/or details of the grid on which a specific
        marching cubes algorithm implementation is operating.
