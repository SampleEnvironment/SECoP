**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Base class to describe the delocalization of point-like objects on a grid. ...

      Base class to describe the delocalization of point-like objects on a grid.

      Such a procedure is for instance used in image processing and e.g. atom probe
      microscopy (APM) to discretize a point cloud onto a grid to enable e.g.
      computing of point density, composition, or concentration values, obtain
      scalar fields, and compute gradients of these fields.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **n_p**: Number of points/objects.

  **n_m**: Number of mark data per point/object.

  **n_atoms**: Number of atoms in the whitelist.

  **n_isotopes**: Number of isotopes in the whitelist.

**Groups cited**:
  none

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXdelocalization/grid-field:

  .. index:: grid (field)

  **grid**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    Reference or link to the grid on which the delocalization is applied.

  .. _/NXdelocalization/objects-field:

  .. index:: objects (field)

  **objects**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    Reference or link to the points which are delocalized on the grid.

  .. _/NXdelocalization/weighting_model-field:

  .. index:: weighting_model (field)

  **weighting_model**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    .. collapse:: The weighting model specifies how mark data are mapped to a weight per point. ...

        The weighting model specifies how mark data are mapped to a weight per point.
        For atom probe microscopy (APM) as an example, different models are used which
        account differently for the multiplicity of an ion/atom:

        * default, points all get the same weight 1.;
          for APM this is equivalent to ion species
        * atomic_decomposition, points get as much weight as they have atoms
          of a type in element_whitelist,
        * isotope_decomposition, points get as much weight as they have
          isotopes of a type in isotope_whitelist.

        This description shows an example that could be reinterpreted for
        similar such data processing steps in other fields of science.

        Any of these values:

          * ``default``

          * ``atomic_decomposition``

          * ``isotope_decomposition``


  .. _/NXdelocalization/element_whitelist-field:

  .. index:: element_whitelist (field)

  **element_whitelist**: (optional) :ref:`NX_UINT <NX_UINT>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [n_atoms]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`} 

    .. collapse:: A list of elements (via proton number) to consider for the atomic_decompositio ...

        A list of elements (via proton number) to consider for the atomic_decomposition
        weighting model. Elements must exist in the periodic table of elements.

  .. _/NXdelocalization/isotope_whitelist-field:

  .. index:: isotope_whitelist (field)

  **isotope_whitelist**: (optional) :ref:`NX_UINT <NX_UINT>` (Rank: 2, Dimensions: [n_isotopes, 2]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`} 

    .. collapse:: A list of isotopes to consider for the isotope_decomposition weighting model. ...

        A list of isotopes to consider for the isotope_decomposition weighting model.
        Isotopes must exist in the nuclid table. Entries in the fastest changing
        dimension should be the pair of proton (first entry) and neutron number
        (second entry).

  .. _/NXdelocalization/mark-field:

  .. index:: mark (field)

  **mark**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 2, Dimensions: [n_p, n_m]) 

    .. collapse:: Attribute data for each member of the point cloud. For APM these are the ...

        Attribute data for each member of the point cloud. For APM these are the
        ion species labels generated via ranging. The number of mark data per
        point is 1 in the case for atom probe.

  .. _/NXdelocalization/weight-field:

  .. index:: weight (field)

  **weight**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` 

    .. collapse:: Weighting factor with which the integrated intensity per grid cell is ...

        Weighting factor with which the integrated intensity per grid cell is
        multiplied specifically for each point. For APM the weight are positive
        integer values, specifically the multiplicity of the ion,
        according to the details of the weighting_model.
