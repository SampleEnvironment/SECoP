**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  Contains the settings of a PID controller.

**Symbols**:

  No symbol table

**Groups cited**:
  :ref:`NXlog`, :ref:`NXsensor`

.. index:: NXsensor (base class); used in base class, NXlog (base class); used in base class

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXpid/description-field:

  .. index:: description (field)

  **description**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    .. collapse:: Description of how the Process Value for the PID controller is produced by sen ...

        Description of how the Process Value for the PID controller is produced by sensor(s) in the setup.

        For example, a set of sensors could be averaged over before feeding it back into the loop.

  .. _/NXpid/setpoint-field:

  .. index:: setpoint (field)

  **setpoint**: (optional) :ref:`NX_FLOAT <NX_FLOAT>` {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANY <NX_ANY>`} 

    .. collapse:: The Setpoint(s) used as an input for the PID controller. ...

        The Setpoint(s) used as an input for the PID controller.

        It can also be a link to an NXsensor.value field.

  .. _/NXpid/K_p_value-field:

  .. index:: K_p_value (field)

  **K_p_value**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` 

    .. collapse:: Proportional term. The proportional term produces an output value ...

        Proportional term. The proportional term produces an output value
        that is proportional to the current error value.
        The proportional response can be adjusted by multiplying the error
        by a constant Kp, called the proportional gain constant.

  .. _/NXpid/K_i_value-field:

  .. index:: K_i_value (field)

  **K_i_value**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` 

    .. collapse:: The contribution from the integral term is proportional to both ...

        The contribution from the integral term is proportional to both
        the magnitude of the error and the duration of the error.
        The integral in a PID controller is the sum of the instantaneous
        error over time and gives the accumulated offset that should have
        been corrected previously. The accumulated error is then
        multiplied by the integral gain (Ki) and added to the
        controller output.

  .. _/NXpid/K_d_value-field:

  .. index:: K_d_value (field)

  **K_d_value**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` 

    .. collapse:: The derivative of the process error is calculated by determining ...

        The derivative of the process error is calculated by determining
        the slope of the error over time and multiplying this rate of
        change by the derivative gain K_d. The magnitude of the
        contribution of the derivative term to the overall control
        action is termed the derivative gain, K_d

  .. _/NXpid/pv_sensor-group:

  **pv_sensor**: (optional) :ref:`NXsensor` 

    .. collapse:: The sensor representing the Process Value used in the feedback loop for the PI ...

        The sensor representing the Process Value used in the feedback loop for the PID.

        In case multiple sensors were used, this NXsensor should contain the proper calculated/aggregated value.

    .. _/NXpid/pv_sensor/value_log-group:

    **value_log**: (optional) :ref:`NXlog` :ref:`⤆ </NXsensor/value_log-group>`


      .. _/NXpid/pv_sensor/value_log/value-field:

      .. index:: value (field)

      **value**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` :ref:`⤆ </NXlog/value-field>`

        The actual timeseries data fed back to the PID loop.
