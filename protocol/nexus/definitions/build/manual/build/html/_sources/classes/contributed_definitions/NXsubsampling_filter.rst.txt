**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  Settings of a filter to sample entries based on their value.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

**Groups cited**:
  none

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXsubsampling_filter/linear_range_min_incr_max-field:

  .. index:: linear_range_min_incr_max (field)

  **linear_range_min_incr_max**: (optional) :ref:`NX_UINT <NX_UINT>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [3]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`} 

    .. collapse:: Triplet of the minimum, increment, and maximum value which will ...

        Triplet of the minimum, increment, and maximum value which will
        be included in the analysis. The increment controls which n-th entry to take.

        Take as an example a dataset with 100 entries (their indices start at zero)
        and the filter set to 0, 1, 99. This will process each entry.
        0, 2, 99 will take each second entry. 90, 3, 99 will take only each third
        entry beginning from entry 90 up to 99.
