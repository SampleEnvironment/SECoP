**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a set of tetrahedra in Euclidean space. ...

      Computational geometry description of a set of tetrahedra in Euclidean space.

      The tetrahedra do not have to be connected.
      As tetrahedral elements they are among hexahedral elements one of the most
      frequently used geometric primitive for meshing and describing volumetric
      and surface descriptions of objects at the continuum scale.

      A set of tetrahedra in 3D Euclidean space.

      The tetrahedra do not have to be connected, can have different size,
      can intersect, and be rotated.

      Tetrahedra are the simplest and thus important geometrical primitive.
      They are frequently used as elements in finite element meshing/modeling.

      Tetrahedra have to be non-degenerated, closed, and built of triangles
      which are not self-intersecting.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **c**: The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of tetrahedra.

        Position of the geometric center, which often is but not necessarily
        has to be the center_of_mass of the tetrahedra.

        Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
        tetrahedra. Identifiers are defined either implicitly
        or explicitly. For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the
        interval [identifier_offset, identifier_offset+c-1].
        For explicit indexing the identifier array has to be defined.

        The identifier_offset field can for example be used to communicate if the
        identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as Fortran-/Matlab-)
        or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index notation) respectively.

  .. _/NXcg_tetrahedron_set/identifier-field:

  .. index:: identifier (field)

  **identifier**: (optional) :ref:`NX_INT <NX_INT>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [c]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_UNITLESS <NX_UNITLESS>`} 

    Integer used to distinguish tetrahedra for explicit indexing.
