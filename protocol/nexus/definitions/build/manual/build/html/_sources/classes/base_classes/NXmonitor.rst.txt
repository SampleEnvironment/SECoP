**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: A monitor of incident beam data. ...

      A monitor of incident beam data.

      It is similar to the :ref:`NXdata` groups containing
      monitor data and its associated axis coordinates, e.g. time_of_flight or
      wavelength in pulsed neutron instruments. However, it may also include
      integrals, or scalar monitor counts, which are often used in both in both
      pulsed and steady-state instrumentation.

**Symbols**:

  No symbol table

**Groups cited**:

        .. index:: plotting

        Declares which child group contains a path leading 
        to a :ref:`NXdata` group.

        It is recommended (as of NIAC2014) to use this attribute
        to help define the path to the default dataset to be plotted.
        See https://www.nexusformat.org/2014_How_to_find_default_data.html
        for a summary of the discussion.

        Elapsed actual counting time, can be an array of size ``np``
        when scanning. This is not the difference of the calendar time
        but the time the instrument was really counting, without
        pauses or times lost due beam unavailability

  .. _/NXmonitor/depends_on-field:

  .. index:: depends_on (field)

  **depends_on**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    .. collapse:: NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations ...

        NeXus positions components by applying a set of translations and rotations
        to apply to the component starting from 0, 0, 0. The order of these operations
        is critical and forms what NeXus calls a dependency chain. The depends_on
        field defines the path to the top most operation of the dependency chain or the
        string "." if located in the origin. Usually these operations are stored in a
        NXtransformations group. But NeXus allows them to be stored anywhere.

        The reference plane of the monitor contains the surface of the detector that faces the source
        and is the entry point of the beam. The reference point of the monitor in the x and y axis is
        its centre on this surface. The reference plane is orthogonal to the the z axis and the
        reference point on this z axis is where they intersect.

    Geometry of the monitor

  .. _/NXmonitor/OFF_GEOMETRY-group:

  **OFF_GEOMETRY**: (optional) :ref:`NXoff_geometry` 

    This group describes the shape of the beam line component

  .. _/NXmonitor/TRANSFORMATIONS-group:

  **TRANSFORMATIONS**: (optional) :ref:`NXtransformations` 

    .. collapse:: This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation ...

        This is the group recommended for holding the chain of translation
        and rotation operations necessary to position the component within
        the instrument. The dependency chain may however traverse similar groups in
        other component groups.
