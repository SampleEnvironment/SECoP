**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: An unvalidated set of terms, such as the description of a beam line. ...

      An unvalidated set of terms, such as the description of a beam line.

      Use :ref:`NXcollection` to gather together any set of terms.
      The original suggestion is to use this as a container 
      class for the description of a beamline.

      For NeXus validation, :ref:`NXcollection` will always generate 
      a warning since it is always an optional group.  
      Anything (groups, fields, or attributes) placed in
      an :ref:`NXcollection` group will not be validated.

**Symbols**:

  No symbol table

  none
