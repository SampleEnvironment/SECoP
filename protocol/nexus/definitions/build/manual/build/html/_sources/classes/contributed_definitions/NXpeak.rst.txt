NXpeak

**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  Description of peaks, their functional form or measured support.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.

  **n_support**: Number of support points

**Groups cited**:
  :ref:`NXcollection`

.. index:: NXcollection (base class); used in base class

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXpeak/label-field:

  .. index:: label (field)

  **label**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    .. collapse:: Human-readable identifier to specify which concept/entity ...

        Human-readable identifier to specify which concept/entity
        the peak represents/identifies.

  .. _/NXpeak/peak_model-field:

  .. index:: peak_model (field)

  **peak_model**: (optional) :ref:`NX_CHAR <NX_CHAR>` 

    .. collapse:: Is the peak described analytically via a functional form ...

        Is the peak described analytically via a functional form
        or is it empirically defined via measured/reported
        intensity/counts as a function of an independent variable.

        If the functional form is not empirical or gaussian, users
        should enter other for the peak_model and add relevant details
        in the NXcollection.

        Any of these values: ``empirical`` | ``gaussian`` | ``lorentzian`` | ``other``

  .. _/NXpeak/position-field:

  .. index:: position (field)

  **position**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [n_support]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANY <NX_ANY>`} 

    .. collapse:: In the case of an empirical description of the peak and its shoulders, ...

        In the case of an empirical description of the peak and its shoulders,
        this array holds the position values for the independent variable.

  .. _/NXpeak/intensity-field:

  .. index:: intensity (field)

  **intensity**: (optional) :ref:`NX_NUMBER <NX_NUMBER>` (Rank: 1, Dimensions: [n_support]) {units=\ :ref:`NX_ANY <NX_ANY>`} 

    .. collapse:: In the case of an empirical description of the peak and its shoulders, ...

        In the case of an empirical description of the peak and its shoulders,
        this array holds the intensity/count values at each position.

  .. _/NXpeak/COLLECTION-group:

  **COLLECTION**: (optional) :ref:`NXcollection` 

    .. collapse:: In the case of an analytical description (or if peak_model is other) this ...

        In the case of an analytical description (or if peak_model is other) this
        collection holds parameter of (and eventually) the functional form.
        For example in the case of Gaussians mu, sigma, cut-off values, 
        and background intensity are relevant parameter.
