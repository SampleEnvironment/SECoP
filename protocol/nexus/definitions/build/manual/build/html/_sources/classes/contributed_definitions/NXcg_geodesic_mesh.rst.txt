**Status**:

  base class, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  .. collapse:: Computational geometry description of a geodesic mesh. ...

      Computational geometry description of a geodesic mesh.

      People from geodesic/surveyors will likely have specific demands and
      different views about what should be included in such a base class, given
      that nested geodesic meshes are a key component of climate modelling tools.
      For now we propose to use this base class as a container to organize metadata
      and data related to geodesic meshes.

      Specifically an instance of this base class should detail the rule set how
      how the geodesic (surface) mesh was instantiated as there are many
      possibilities. A geodesic surface mesh is in this sense a triangulated
      surface mesh with metadata. For additional details as an introduction
      into the topic see e.g.:

      * `E. S. Popko and C. J. Kitrick <https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003134114>`_

      Here, especially the section on subdivision schemes is relevant.

**Symbols**:

  The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
