        Specifies the position of the deflector by pointing to the last transformation
        in the transformation chain in the NXtransformations group.

  .. _/NXdeflector/TRANSFORMATIONS-group:

  **TRANSFORMATIONS**: (optional) :ref:`NXtransformations`

        Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe the location and
        geometry of the deflector as a component in the instrument. Conventions from the
        NXtransformations base class are used. In principle, the McStas coordinate
        system is used. The first transformation has to point either to another
        component of the system or . (for pointing to the reference frame) to relate it
        relative to the experimental setup. Typically, the components of a system should
        all be related relative to each other and only one component should relate to
        the reference coordinate system.
