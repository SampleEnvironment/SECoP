          or the principle investigator. The identifier enables to link
          experiments to e.g. proposals.

          Users are strongly advised to detail the sample history in the 
          respective field and fill rather as completely as possible the fields
          of this application definition rather than write details about the
          experiment into this free-text description field.

          Specify if the (characterization) results/data of this instance of an
          application definition are based on the results of a simulation or the
          results of a post-processing of measured data to describe
          a microstructure.

          The term microstructure is used to describe the spatial arrangement of
          crystal defects inside a sample/specimen without demanding necessarily
          that this structure is mainly at the micron length scale.
          Nanostructure and macrostructure are close synonyms.
          Material architecture is a narrow synonym.

          Given that microstructure simulations nowadays more and more consider
          the atomic arrangement, this application definition can also be used
          to describe features at the scale of atoms.

          Any of these values: ``experiment`` | ``simulation``

              Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing

              if the identifiers are expected to start from 1 (referred to as
              Fortran-/Matlab-) or from 0 (referred to as C-, Python-style index

          **MS_FEATURE_SET**: (optional) :ref:`NXms_feature_set` 

            .. collapse:: Conceptually distinguished object/feature in the ROI/ ...

                Conceptually distinguished object/feature in the ROI/
                system with some relevance. Instances of NXms_feature_set can
                be nested to build a hierarchy of logically-related objects.

                A typical example for MD simulations is to have one
                ms_feature_set for the atoms which is the parent to another
                ms_feature_set for monomers/molecules/proteins which is then the
                parent to another ms_feature_set for the secondary, another feature_set
                for the tertiary, and the parent for another feature_set for the
                quaternary structure.

                Another typical example from materials engineering is to have
                one ms_feature_set for crystals (grains/phases) which serves as
                the parent to another ms_feature_set for interfaces between these
                crystals which then is the parent for another ms_feature_set to
                describe the triple junctions which is then the parent for the
                quadruple/higher-order junctions between which connect the
                triple lines.

                Another example from discrete dislocation dynamics could be to
                have one ms_feature_set for the dislocations (maybe separate
                sets for each dislocation type or family) which are then
                parents to other ms_feature_set which describe junctions between
                dislocations or features along the dislocation line network.
