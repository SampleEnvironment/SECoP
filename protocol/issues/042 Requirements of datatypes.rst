SECoP Issue 42: Requirements of datatypes (closed)
==================================================

Motivation
----------
Using JSON as part of the transport mechanisms leave a few details about properties of datatypes open.
Especially, the JSON-number format is both used for floating point values and for integers.
Also the JSON-number is agnostic to the datatype used in implementations.

So far it is unspecified if there are expectations towards the precision/resolution and range of the
numeric data which is supposed to be transported via SECoP.
This was circumvented by specifiying a C-api datatype.
Since there are more programming languages around than we can specify a valid datatype for,
it makes sense to move the documentation of a specific C-api elsewhere.

That would leave the problem of having undefined value ranges/precisions in SECoP.

It is up to now unclear if SECoP should even define something or leave this to the application.
Also, one of the design decisions was to optimize SECoP to allow low-end hardware to act as SEC-node.
Insofar it is contradictory for a low-end microcontroller or PLC to have to use 64bit double floating formats,
especially, if a 24 bit fixed point format would have sufficed!

On the ECS-side there seem to be no obvious problem with specifying to use 64 bit representations,
as these machines are always assumed to be powerful enough.
Since the SEC-node can present limits on the used double and int values,
the required range to be supported can be deduced by an ECS.
It then MUST NOT send values outside that range wich is exactly what the current specification
of numeric datatypes requests.
So the missing information of the ECS is the resolution the SEC-node can handle.
As successful requests to the SEC-node return a reply containing the actually used value,
the ECS can deduce the useable resolution of the SEC-node.

Proposal
--------
The specification of the C api of the HZB-dll should be moved to a separate document.

It should be discussed what value range/resolution is really expected in SECoP. (if at all)
So far, no modules were found which require more than 3 subdigits or a value range bigger than 0...2000.

A text similiar to the following should be included in the specification:

  The ECS SHOULD send floating point values with the full precision its implementation allows,
  the SEC-node uses as many digits as it can handle and ignores the rest.
  In the reply, the SEC-node uses as many digits, as its implementation allow.
  Also, if an SEC-node uses representations smaller than a predefined (say 64 bit double) one, it MUST
  specify all double or int datatypes with the acceptable limits in the descriptive data.
  (Otherwise, it SHOULD fully specify number ranges.)

  An ECS MUST support AT LEAST the full 32bit float value range and precision,
  but SHOULD use 64bit double values internally.

  The implementation of a SEC-node may use internally whatever it wants,
  as long as it behaves correctly (i.e. parses JSON number correctly or return an error if they are outside acceptable ranges.)

Discussion
----------
Discussion is clearly needed.
No detailed discussion of the proposal so far.

It may also be necessary to adapt the definition of the datatypes by removing the unlimited option,i.e.
the numeric datatypes could be ALWAYS restricted.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

decision:
 - specification of the HZB C-api will be moved someplace els
 - the limits on all datatypes are always to be specified. Exception: for ``["double"]``, each of the two limits may be specified as ``null``.
 - the limits are alwasy to be specified in min,max order.
 - an optional parameter-property ``precision`` is to be defined, specifying a 2-tuple [ number of significant digits, smallest difference between distinct values ].
 - SECoP assumes, an Integer be representable with signed 24 bits (i.e. all integers SHOULD fit inside -2\ :sup:`24` ... 2\ :sup:`24`),
   as some JSON libraries parse JSON-numbers with 32bit float too.
   Also no use case of a bigger integer was found.
 - physical quantities SHOULD be represented by ``["double"]`` and not by ``["int"]`` !
 - a new Issue is to be created for 'scaled integers' see `Issue 44`_
 - issue is to be closed (for now)

after thoughts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It makes more sense to define two properties:

precision:
    a double type value specifiying the smallest difference between distinct values (should be called resolution then)

fmtstr:
    a string containing formatting options (used to display values to the user)
    follows a syntax of  ``% [digits] . [digits] [f|g|e]`` or similiar.
    may also be more restricitve like ``%.[digit] (e|f|g)``.
