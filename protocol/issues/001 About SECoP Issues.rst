SECoP Issue 1: About SECoP Issues (closed)
==========================================

The idea behind SECoP Issues is to document properly what was proposed,
what was discussed, what was decided and why it was decided.

An issue might take different states:

(u) unspecified
---------------

a vague idea, but no proposal written down yet

(p) proposed
------------

A proposal should contain the motivation. As long as nobody else
joins into a discussion, the state remains *proposed*

(d) under discussion
--------------------

This state is kept until there is a decision taken.

(f) finalizing
--------------

This state is kept until the specification change is agreed.

( ) closed
----------

After a decision the state is *closed*. The issue is not deleted,
even if the decision was to not follow further the proposal.
This is helpful if somebody later rises a similar issue.
However, it should be possible to reopen an issue, if new
arguments arise.

Remark:
-------

At the meeting in Lund (13th June 2018), it was agreed not to follow the proposal
of creating a new state "extensible" for an issue containing an extensible
list. Instead, an new issue should be created, containing the added elements.
A full actual list should be added each time.
