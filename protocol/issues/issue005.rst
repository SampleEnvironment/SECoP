SECoP Issue 5: Definition of the term 'Property' (under discussion)
===================================================================

The definition as in SECoP V2016-11-30 draft is not very consistent.

As decriptive data we have:

- SEC node properties
- module properties
- parameters properties
- command properties

Live data may be:
- value
- timestamp 't'
- sigma 'e'

It is confusing to use the same term 'property' for live data and for
descriptive data.

The section with the definition of properties has to be rewritten.

Opinions
--------

Enrico proposed to name live data like timestamps and sigma 'qualifiers'.

Markus supports this. He would be happy also with an other term than
'qualifiers', but definitely does not like the terms 'live properties' and
'descriptive properties', as two different things share the same name.


Decision
--------
