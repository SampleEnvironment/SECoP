SECoP: Sample Environment Communication Protocol
################################################

intermediate version V2019-07-08

Introduction
============

The main goal of the "committee for the standardization of sample
environment communication" is to establish a common standard protocol
SECoP for interfacing sample environment equipment to experiment control
software.

Definition: Experiment Control Software ECS
     Software controlling the hardware for carrying out an experiment.
     Includes the user interface. Usually speaks several protocols with
     different parts of the instrument.
     Often also called short instrument control.

There is a task (7.1) within the European framework SINE2020 also
dealing with this subject. In its description we read::

    ... The standard should be defined in a way that it is compatible
    with a broad variety of soft- and hardware operated at the different
    large scale facilities. … The adoption of this standard will greatly
    facilitate the installation of new equipment and the share of
    equipment between the facilities. ...

This does also cover the aims of the committee.

The idea is, that a sample environment apparatus can easily be moved
between facilities and instruments/beamlines. As long as the facilities
have implemented a SECoP client within its ECS, and on the apparatus a
SECoP server is implemented as the SEC node, using the apparatus for an
experiment should be straightforward. An ECS can be built in a way, that
the configuration of a SEC node may be as short as entering a network
address, as the description can be loaded over the protocol.

Definition: Sample Environment Control Node (SEC node)
    Computing unit or process or task, connected to all control units (temperature controller,
    flow controller, pressure sensor ...) of a sample environment, bridge to the ECS.
    SECoP specifies how ECS speaks with the SEC node.
    The SEC node allows the ECS to access a set of modules (and their parameters/commands) via the SECoP.
    It also provides a list of accessible modules and parameters as well as descriptive meta data.

Other requirements
------------------

-  the protocol should be easy to use

-  it should be easy to implement in connection with existing ECSs and
   sample environment control software

-  it should be possible to be implemented on the most common platforms
   (operating systems and programming languages)

-  the protocol should be defined in way that allows a maximum
   **compatibility**: Newer and older versions of the syntax should
   be compatible

-  the protocol should be defined in a way, which allows a maximum
   **flexibility**: A simple (= with minimal features) ECS
   implementation should be able to communicate with a complex SEC
   node (with a lot of features), and an ECS with a rich number of
   features should be able to cope with a simple SEC node,
   implementing only a minimum number of features/functionality

Modules
-------

Definition: Module
    One logical component of an abstract view of the sample environment. Can at least be read.
    May be ’driven' (set new setpoint). May have parameters influencing how it achieves
    its function (e.g. PID parameters). May have some additional diagnostics (read-only) parameters.
    May provide some additional status information (temperature stable?, setpoint reached?)
    Reading a module returns the result of the corresponding physical measurement.

We intentionally avoid the term "device", which might
be misleading, as "device" is often used for an entire apparatus, like a
cryomagnet or humidity cell. In the context of SECoP, an apparatus in
general is composed of several modules. For example different
temperature sensors in one apparatus are to be seen as different modules.

An SEC node controls a set of named modules. Modules also have
some descriptive data (type, list-of-parameters, list-of-commands, ...).

Accessibles
-----------

A module has several accessibles associated with it. An accessible is
addressed by the combination of module and accessible name. Module names
have to be unique within an SEC node, accessible names have to be unique
within a module. There are two basic types of accessibles: parameters and commands.

Module and accessible names should be in english (incl. acronyms), using
only ASCII letters + digits and some additional characters (see section `Protocol`_).
The maximum name length is 63 characters.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter:
    The main parameter of a module is its value. Writable parameters may influence the
    measurement (like PIDs). Additional parameters may give more information about its
    state (running, target reached), or details about its functioning (heater power) for
    diagnostics purposes. Parameters with a predefined meaning are listed in the standard,
    they must always be used in the same way. Custom parameters are defined by the
    implementation of the SEC node, the ECS can use them only in a general way, as their
    meaning is not known.


The following parameters are predefined (this list will be extended):

- value
    represents the *main* value of a module.

- status
    (a tuple of two elements: a status with predefined values
    from an Enum_ as "idle","busy","error", and a describing text).

    .. table:: assignment of status codes

         ============ ============== =========================================
          statuscode   variant name   Meaning
         ============ ============== =========================================
            0           DISABLED      Module is not enabled
          100           IDLE          Module is not performing any action
          200           WARN          The same as IDLE, but something may not be alright, though it is not a problem (yet)
          300           BUSY          Module is performing some action
          400           ERROR         Module is in an error state, something turned out to be a problem.
         ============ ============== =========================================

    Codes 1 to 99, codes of the form x0y and codes above 499 are reserved for future use by the standard.
    Code 401 (Name: UNKNOWN) is a predefined value for ERROR, its meaning is: the SEC node can not (yet)
    determine the status.
    
    Codes 110...199, 210...299, 310...399 and 410...499 are custom codes. Their meaning
    can be defined by the implementor (see `implementor`_ property). The ECS MUST treat the
    second and first digit as 0, if it does not know about the specific meaning defined by
    the implementor.

    :related issue: `SECoP Issue 37: Clarification of status`_

    :Note:
        the behaviour of a module in each of the predefined states is not yet 100% defined.

    :Note:
        a module only need to declare the status values which it implements. i.e. an Readable module
        does not need a BUSY status.

- target
    present, if the modules main value is to be changeable remotely, i.e. it is at least a Writable

- pollinterval
    a hint to the module for the polling interval in seconds, type is always an double.

- ramp
    (writable parameter, desired ramp. Units: main units/min)

- setpoint
    (ramping setpoint, read only)

- time_to_target
    (read only double, expected time to reach target in seconds)

- mode
    A parameter of datatype enum, for selecting the operation mode of a module.
    The available operation modes can not be predefined in the specification, since
    they depend on the specific module.
    The value 0 SHOULD be used as default, and be the mode which is used normally.

    Example:
    a temperate controller module may define the mode as follows:

    .. code::

        ["enum",{"pid": 0, "ramp": 1, "openloop": 2}]

    i.e. it supports three modes: "pid", "ramp" and "openloop".
    The meaning of the operation modes SHOULD be described in the description.

Commands
~~~~~~~~

Command:
    Commands are provided to initiate specified actions of the module.
    They should generate an appropriate reply immediately after that action is initiated,
    i.e. should not wait until some other state is reached.
    However, if the command triggers side-effects, they MUST be communicated before the reply is sent.
    Commands may use an possibly structured argument and may return a possibly structured result.
    Commands with a predefined meaning are listed in the standard,
    they must always be used in the same way.

Custom commands are defined by the implementation of the SEC node, the
ECS can use them only in a general way, as their meaning is not known.


The following commands are predefined (extensible):

-  **stop**
     mandatory command on a drivable.
     When a modules target is changed (or, if present, when the ``go`` command is sent),
     it is 'driving' to a new value until the target is reached or until its stop command
     is sent.
     When the ``stop`` command is sent, the SEC node SHOULD set the target parameter
     to a value close to the present one. Then it SHOULD act as if this value would have
     been the initial target.

-  **communicate**
     Used for direct communication with hardware, with proprietary commands. It is useful
     for debugging purposes, or if the implementor wants to give access to parameters not
     supported by the driver. The datatype might be string, or any other datatype suitable
     to the protocol of the device. The ``communicate`` command  is meant to be used in
     module with the ``Communicator`` interface class.

-  **reset**
     optional command for putting the module to a state predefined by the implementation.

-  **clear_errors**
     This command tries to clear an error state. It may be called when status is ERROR,
     and the command will try to transfrom status to IDLE or WARN. If it can not
     do it, the status should not change or change to an other ERROR state before
     returning ``done <module>:clear_errors``

-  **go**
     optional command for starting an action. If the ``go`` command is present,
     changing any parameter (especially the 'target' parameter) does not yet initiate any
     action leading to a BUSY state.
     In contrast, if no 'go' command is present, changing the target will start an action
     trying to change the value to get closer to the target, which usually leads to a BUSY
     state. Changing any parameter, which has an impact on measured values, should
     be executed immediately.

-  **hold**
     optional command on a drivable. Stay more or less where you are, cease
     movement, be ready to continue soon, target value is kept. Continuation can be
     trigger with ``go``, or if not present, by putting the target parameter to its
     present value.

-  **shutdown**
     optional command for shuting down the hardware.
     When this command is sent, and the triggered action is finished (status in idle mode),
     it is safe to switch off the related device.

     :Remark:

        there is an alternative proposal for
        implementing the shutdown function, see `SECoP Issue 22: Enable Module instead of Shutdown Command`_


Properties
----------

Definition: Properties
    The static information about parameters, modules and SEC nodes is
    constructed from properties with predefined names and meanings.

For a list of pre-defined properties see `Descriptive Data`_.


Data report
-----------
A JSON array with the value of a parameter as its first element,
and an JSON object containing the Qualifiers_ for this value as its second element.

:Remark:

    future revisions may append additional elements.
    These are to be ignored for implementations of the current specification


Error report
------------
An error report is used in a `error reply`_ indicating that the requested action could
not be performed as request or that other problems occured.
The Error report is a JSON-array containing the request message leading to the report error
(minus line endings) as a string in its first element, a (short) human readable text
as its second element. The third element is a JSON-Object, containing possibly
implementation specific information about the error (stack dump etc.).

:Note:
    See Qualifiers_ 'error', for errors not related to a request, but occuring while
    determining a parameter.


Structure report
----------------
The structure report is a structured JSON construct describing the structure of the SEC node.
This includes the SEC-node properties, the modules, their module-properties and accessibles
and the properties of the accessibles.
For details see `descriptive data`_.

Value
-----
Values are transferred as a JSON-Value.

:Programming Hint:

    Some JSON libraries do not allow simple JSON values in their conversion functions.
    Whether or not a simple JSON value is a valid JSON text, is controversial,
    see this `stackoverflow issue <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19569221>`_ and :rfc:`8259`

    (clarification: a *JSON document* is either a *JSON object* or a *JSON array*,
    a *simple JSON value* (for example a bare string or number) is a *JSON value*,
    which is not a *JSON document*)

    If an implementation uses a libray, which can not convert simple JSON values,
    the implemetation can add angular brackets around a JSON value, decode it
    and take the first element of the result. When encoding the reverse action might be
    used as a workaround. See also :RFC:`7493`


Qualifiers
----------

Qualifiers optionally augment the value in a reply from the SEC node,
and present variable information about that parameter.
They are collected as named values in a JSON-object.

Currently 2 qualifiers are defined:

- "t"
    The timestemp when the parameter has changed or was verified/measured (when no timestamp
    is given, the ECS may use the arrival time of the update message as the timestamp).
    It SHOULD be given, if the SEC node has a synchronized time,
    the format is that of a UNIX time stamp, i.e. seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00Z,
    represented as a number, in general a floating point when the resolution
    is better than 1 second.

    :Note:
        To check if a SEC node supports time stamping, a `ping` request can be sent.
        (See also `heartbeat`_).

- "e"
   the uncertainity of the quantity. MUST be in the same units
   as the value. So far the interpretation of "e" is not fixed.
   (sigma vs. RMS difference vs. ....)

- "error"
   If an error occurs while determining a parameter, this qualifier contains a
   modified error report. See 'update'_.

other qualifiers might be added later to the standard.
If an unknown element is encountered, it is to be ignored.



Interface Classes
-----------------

The idea is, that the ECS can determine the functionality of a module
from its class.

The standard contains a list of classes, and a specification of the
functionality for each of them. The list might be extended over time.
Already specified base classes may be extended in later releases of the
specification, but earlier definitions will stay intact, i.e. no
removals or redefinitions will occur.

The module class is in fact a list of classes (highest level class
first) and is stored in the module-property `interface_class`.
The ECS chooses the first class from the list which is known to it.
The last one in the list must be one of the base classes listed above.

:Remark:

    The list may also be empty, indicating that the module in question does not even conform to the Readable class!

Base classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Readable (has at least a value and a status parameter)

-  Writable (must have a target parameter to a Readable)

-  Drivable (a Writable, must have a stop command, the status parameter will indicate
   Busy for a longer-lasting operation)

More Interface Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Communicator:
    Has a communicate command.

    The communicate command is used mainly for debugging reasons, or as a workaround
    for using hardware features not implemented in the SEC node.


Protocol
========

.. contents::
    :depth: 1
    :local:
    :backlinks: entry


The basic element of the protocol are messages.


Message Syntax
--------------
The received byte stream which is exchanged via a connection is split into messages:

.. image:: images/messages.svg
   :alt: messages ::= (message CR? LF) +

A message is essentially one line of text, coded in ASCII (may be extended to UTF-8
later if needed). A message ends with a line feed character (ASCII 10), which may be preceded
by a carriage return character (ASCII 13), which must be ignored.

All messages share the same basic structure:

.. image:: images/message-structure.svg
   :alt: message_structure ::= action ( SPACE specifier ( SPACE data )? )?

i.e. message starts with an action keyword, followed optionally by one space and a specifier
(not containing spaces), followed optionally by one space and a JSON-text
formatted value (see :RFC:`8259`) called data, which absorbs the remaining characters up to the
final LF.

:Note:
    numerical values and strings appear 'naturally' formatted in JSON-text, i.e. 5.0 or "a string".

The specifier consists of a module identifier and for most actions followed by a colon as separator
and a parameter or command identifier:

.. image:: images/specifier.svg
   :alt: specifier ::= module | module ":" (parameter|command)

All identifiers (for properties, accessibles and modules) are composed by
ASCII letters, digits and underscore, where a digit may not
appear as the first character.

.. image:: images/name.svg
   :alt: name ::= [a-zA-Z_] [a-zA-Z0-9_]*

Identifiers starting with underscore ('custom-names') are
reserved for special purposes like internal use for debugging. The
identifier length is limited (<=63 characters).

Albeit names MUST be compared/stored case sensitive, names in each scope need to be unique when lowercased.
The scopes are:

- module names on a SEC Node (including the group entries of those modules)
- accessible names of a module (including the group entries of those parameters) (each module has its own scope)
- properties
- names of elements in a struct (each struct has its own scope)
- names of variants in an enum (each enum has its own scope)
- names of qualifiers

SECoP defined names are usually lowercase, though that is not a restriction (esp. not for module names).

A SEC node might implement custom messages for debugging purposes, which are not
part of the standard. Custom messages start with an underscore or might just be
an empty line. The latter might be used as a request for a help text, when logged
in from a command line client like telnet or netcat. Messages not starting with
an underscore and not defined in the following list are reserved for future extensions.

When implementing SEC nodes or ECS-clients, a 'MUST-ignore' policy should be applied to unknown
or additional parts.
Unknown or malformed messages are to be replied with an appropriate ``ProtocolError`` by a SEC node.
An ECS-client must ignore such messages. See also section `Future Compatibility`_.

Essentially the connections between an ECS and a SEC node can operate in one of two modes:

Synchroneous mode:
   where a strict request/reply pattern is used

Async mode:
   where an update may arrive any time (between messages).

In both cases, a request from the ECS to the SEC node is to be followed by an reply from the SEC node to the ECS,
either indicating success of the request or flag an error.

:Note:
    an ECS may try to send a request before it received the reply to an earlier request.
    This has two implications: a SEC-node may serialize requests and fulfil them strictly in order.
    In that case the ECS should not overflow the input buffer of the SEC-node.
    The second implication is that an ECS which sends multiple requests, before the replies arrive,
    MUST be able to handle the replies arriving out-of-order. Unfortunately there is currently no indication
    if a SEC-node is operating strictly in order or if it can work on multiple requests simultaneously.


:Note:
    to improve compatibility, any ECS client SHOULD always be aware of updates.

:Note:
    to clarify optionality of some messages, the following table is split into two:
    basic messages (which MUST be implemented like specified) and extended messages which SHOULD be implemented.

:Note:
    for clarification, the symbol "``␣``" is used here instead of a space character. <elem> refers to the element elem which is defined in another section.

    ======================= ============== ==================


Theory of operation:
    The first messages to be exchanged after the a connection between an ECS and a SEC node is established
    is to verify that indeed the SEC node is speaking a supported protocol by sending an identification_ request
    and checking the answer from the SEC node to comply.
    If this check fails, the connection is to be closed and an error reported.
    The second step is to query the structure of the SEC node by exchange of description_ messages.
    After this step, the ECS knows all it needs to know about this SEC node and can continue to either
    stick to a request/reply pattern or `activate updates`_.
    In any case, an ECS should correctly handle updates, even if it didn't activate them,
    as that may have been performed by another client on a shared connection.

Correct handling of side-effects:
  To avoid difficult to debug race conditions, the following sequence of events should be followed,
  whenever the ECS wants to initiate an action:

  1) ECS sends the initiating message request (either ``change`` target or ``do`` go) and awaits the response.

  2) SEC-Node checks the request and if it can be performed. If not, SEC-node sends an error-reply (sequence done).
     If nothing is actually to be done, continue to point 4)

  3) SEC-Node 'sets' the status-code to BUSY and instructs the hardware to execute
     the requested action.
     Also an ``update`` status event (with the new BUSY status-code) MUST be sent
     to ALL subscribed clients (if any).
     From now on all read requests will also reveal a BUSY status-code.
     If additional parameters are influenced, their updated values should be communicated as well.

  4) SEC-Node sends the reply to the request of point 2) indicating the success of the request.

     :Note:
         This may also be an error. In that case point 3) was likely not fully performed.

     :Note:
        An error may be replied after the status was sent to BUSY:
        if triggering the intented action failed (Communication problems?).

  5) An event based ECS which **may** process the ``update`` message from point 3)
     after the reply of point 4) MUST query the status parameter synchronously
     to avoid the race-condition of missing the (possible) BUSY status-code.

     :Note:
         temporal order should be kept wherever possible!

  6) when the action is finally finshed and the module no longer to be considered BUSY,
     an ``update`` status event MUST be sent, also subsequent status queries
     should reflect the now no longer BUSY state. Of course, all other parameters influenced by this should also
     communicate their new values.



Message intents
---------------

Identification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The syntax of the identification message differs a little bit from other
messages, as it should be compatible with IEEE 488.2. The identification
request "\ **\*IDN?**\ " is meant to be sent as the first message after
establishing a connection. The reply consists of 4 comma separated
fields, where the second and third field determine the used protocol.

In this and in the following examples, messages sent to the server are marked with "> ",
and messages sent to the client are marked with "< "

Example:

.. code::

  > *IDN?
  < ISSE&SINE2020,SECoP,V2018-11-07,v1.0\beta

So far the SECoP version is given like "V2018-11-07", i.e. a capital "V" followed by a date in
``year-month-day`` format with 4 and 2 digits respectively.
The ``add.info`` field was used to differentiate between draft, release candidates (rc1, rc2,...) and final.
It is now used to indicate a release name.


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The next messages normally exchanged are the description request and
reply. The reply contains the `Structure report`_ i.e. a structured JSON object describing the name of
modules exported and their parameters, together with the corresponding
properties.

Example:

The dot (second item in the reply message) is a placeholder for extensibility reasons.
A client implementing the current specification MUST ignore it.

:Remark:

    this reply might be a very long line, no raw line breaks are allowed in the
    JSON part! I.e. the JSON-part should be as compact as possible.

:Note:
    The use of a single dot for the specifier is a little contrary to the other messages addressing the
    SEC-node. It may be changed in a later revision. ECS-clients are advised to ignore the specifier part
    of the describing message. A SEC-node SHOULD use a dot for the specifier.

Activate Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parameterless "activate" request triggers the SEC node to send the
values of all its modules and parameters as update messages (initial updates). When this
is finished, the SEC node must send an "active" reply. (*global activation*)

:Note:
    the values transferred are not necessarily read fresh from the hardware, check the timestamps!

:Note:
    This initial update is to help the ECS establish a copy of the 'assumed-to-be-current' values.

:Note:
    An ECS MUST be able to handle the case of an update occuring during the initial phase is over, i.e.
    it must handle the case of receiving more than one update for any valid specifier.

A SEC node might accept a module name as second item of the
message (*module-wise activation*), activating only updates on the parameters of the selected module.
In this case, the "active" reply also contains the module name.

A SEC Node not implementing module-wise activation MUST NOT sent the module
name in its reply to an module-wise activation request,
and MUST activate all modules (*fallback mode*).

Update
~~~~~~

When activated, update messages are delivered without explicit request
from the client. The value is a `Data report`_, i.e. a JSON array with the value as its first
element, and an JSON object containing the `Qualifiers`_ as its second element.

An update may also be triggered by an `read request`_, in which case the value reported in the data report is fresh (i.e. just obtained from a hw).

If an error occurs while determining a parameter, an update message has to be sent,
with null for the value, and with a the qualifier "error" containing a modified error
report. The latter is structured like the normal <`Error Report`_>, but with the first
elements containing the error class as a string instead of the request message.

Example:

.. code::

  > activate
  < update t1:value [295.13,{"t":150539648.188388,"e":0.01}]
  < update t1:status [[400,"heater broken or disconnected"],{"t":1505396348.288388}]
  < active
  < update t1:value [295.14,{"t":1505396349.259845,"e":0.01}]
  < update t1:value [295.13,{"t":1505396350.324752,"e":0.01}]

The example shows an ``activate`` request triggering an initial update of two values:
t1:value and t1:status, followed by the ``active`` reply.
After this two more updates on the t1:value show up after roughly 1s between each.

:Note:
    it is vital that all initial updates are sent, **before** the 'active' reply is sent!
    (an ECS may rely on having gotten all values)

:Note:
    to speed up the activation process, polling + caching of all parameters on the SEC-node is adviced,
    i.e. the parameters should not just be read for activation, as this may take a long time.


Deactivate Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A parameterless message. After the "inactive" reply no more updates are
delivered if not triggered by a read message.

Example:

.. code::

  > deactivate
  < update t1:value [295.13,{"t":1505396348.188388}]
  < inactive

:Remark:

    the update message in the second line was sent before the deactivate message
    was treated. After the "inactive" message, the client can expect that no more untriggered
    update message are sent, though it MUST still be able to handle (or ignore) them, if they still
    occur.

The deactivate message might optionally accept a module name as second item
of the message for module-wise deactivation. If module-wise deactivation is not
supported, it should ignore a deactivate message which contains a module name.

:Remark:

    it is not clear, if module-wise deactivation is really useful. A SEC Node
    supporting module-wise activation does not necessarily need to support module-wise
    deactivation.

Change Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~

the change value message contains the name of the module or parameter
and the value to be set. The value is JSON formatted.
As soon as the set-value is read back from the hardware, all clients,
having activated the parameter/module in question, get an "update" message.
After all side-effects are communicated, a "changed" reply is then send, containing a
`Data report`_ of the read-back value.

:Remarks:

    * If the value is not stored in hardware, the "update" message can be sent immediately.
    * The read-back value should always reflect the value actually used.
    * an client having activated updates may get an ``update`` message before the ``changed`` message, both containing the same data report.


Example on a connection with activated updates. Qualifiers are replaced by {...} for brevity here.

.. code::

  > read mf:status
  < update mf:status [[100,"OK"],{...}]
  > change mf:target 12
  < update mf:status [[300,"ramping field"],{...}]
  < update mf:target [12,{...}]
  < changed mf:target [12,{...}]
  < update mf:value [0.01293,{...}]

The status changes from "idle" (100) to "busy" (300).
The ECS will be informed with a further update message on mf:status,
when the module has finished ramping.
Until then, it will get regular updates on the current main value (see last update above).

:Note:
    it is vital that all 'side-effects' are realized (i.e. stored in internal variables) and be communicated, **before** the 'changed' reply is sent!


Read Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the read request message the ECS may ask the SEC node to update a
value as soon as possible, without waiting for the next regular update.
The reply is an update message.
If updates are not activated, the update message can also be treated like a reply request
to the read request.

Example:

.. code::

  > read t1:value
  < update t1:value [295.13,{"t":1505396348.188}]
  > read t1:status
  > update t1:status [[100,"OK"],{"t":1505396348.548}]

:Remark:

    If a client has activated the module/parameter for which it sent a ``read`` request,
    it may receive more than one 'update' message, especially if SEC node side polling is active.
    There is no indication, which message was sent due to polling (or other clients requesting a 'read')
    and or due to a specific read. An ECS-client may just use the first matching message and treat it
    as 'the reply'.


Execute Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a command is specified with an argument, the actual argument is given in
the data part as a json-text. This may be also a json-object if the datatype of
the argument specifies that
(i.e. the type of the single argument can also be a struct, tuple or an array, see `data types`_).
The types of arguments must conform to the declared datatypes from the datatype of the command argument.

A command may also have a return value, which may also be structured.
The "done" reply always contains a `Data report`_ with the return value.
If no value is returned, the data part is set to "null".
The "done" message should be returned quickly, the time scale should be in the
order of the time needed for communications. Still, all side-effects need to be realized
and communicated before.
Actions which have to wait for physical changes, can be triggered with a command, but not be waited upon.
The information about the duration and success of such an action has to be transferred via the status parameter.

.. important:: If a command does not require an argument, an argument MAY still be transferred as json-null.
 A SEC node MUST also accept the message, if the data part is emtpy and perform the same action.
 More precisely, any SEC-node MUST treat the following two messages the same:

 - ``do <module>:<command>``
 - ``do <module>:<command> null``

 An ECS SHOULD only generate the shorter version.

Example:

.. code::

  > do t1:stop
  < done t1:stop [null,{"t":1505396348.876}]

  > do t1:stop null
  < done t1:stop [null,{"t":1505396349.743}]


Error Reply
~~~~~~~~~~~

Contains an error class from the list below as its second item.
The third item of the message is an `Error report`_, containing the request message
(minus line endings) as a string in its first element, a (short) human readable text
as its second element. The third element is a JSON-Object, containing possibly
implementation specific information about the error (stack dump etc.).

Example:

.. code::

  > read tx:target
  < error NoSuchModule ["read tx:target", "tx is not configured on this SEC node", {}]
  > change ts:target 12
  < error NoSuchParameter ["change ts:target 12", "ts has no parameter target", {}]
  > change t:target -9
  < error BadValue ["change t:target -9", "requested value (-9) is outside limits (0..300)", {}]
  > meas:volt?
  < error ProtocolError ["meas:volt?", "unknown keyword", {}]

Error Classes


Error classes are divided into two groups: persisting errors and retryable errors.
Persisting errors will yield the exact same error messge if the exact same request is sent at any later time.
A retryable error may give different results if the exact same message is sent at a later time, i.e.
they depend on state information internal to either the sec-node, the module or the connected hardware.

.. list-table:: persisting errors
    :widths: 20 80

    * - NoSuchModule
      - The action can not be performed as the specified module is non-existent.

    * - NoSuchParameter
      - The action can not be performed as the specified parameter is non-existent.

    * - NoSuchCommand
      - The specified command does not exist.

    * - ReadOnly
      - The requested write can not be performed on a readonly value..

    * - WrongType
      - The requested parameter change or Command can not be performed as the argument has the wrong type.
        (i.e. a string where a number is expected.)
        It may also be used if an incomplete struct is sent, but a complete struct is expected.

    * - RangeError
      - The requested parameter change or Command can not be performed as the argument value is not
        in the allowed range specified by the datatype property.
        This also happens if an unspecified Enum variant is tried to be used, the size of a Blob or String
        does not match the limits given in the descriptive data, or if the number of elements in an array
        does not match the limits given in the descriptive data.

    * - OutOfRange
      - The value read from the hardware is out of sensor or calibration range

    * - BadJSON
      - The data part of the message can not be parsed, i.e. the JSON-data is no valid JSON.

    * - NotImplemented
      - A (not yet) implemented action or combination of action and specifer was requested.
        This should not be used in productive setups, but is very helpful during development.

    * - HardwareError
      - The connected hardware operates incorrect or may not operate at all due to errors inside or in connected components.

    * - ProtocolError
      - A malformed Request or on unspecified message was sent.
        This includes non-understood actions and malformed specifiers. Also if the message exceeds an implementation defined maximum size.
        *note: this may be retryable if induced by a noisy connection. Still that should be fixed first!*

.. list-table:: retryable errors
    :widths: 20 80

    * - CommandRunning
      - The command is already executing. request may be retried after the module is no longer BUSY.

    * - CommunicationFailed
      - Some communication (with hardware controlled by this SEC node) failed.

    * - TimeoutError
      - Some initiated action took longer than the maximum allowed time.

    * - IsBusy
      - The requested action can not be performed while the module is Busy or the command still running.

    * - IsError
      - The requested action can not be performed while the module is in error state.

    * - Disabled
      - The requested action can not be performed while the module is disabled.

    * - Impossible
      - The requested action can not be performed at the moment.

    * - ReadFailed
      - The requested parameter can not be read just now.

    * - InternalError
      - Something that should never happen just happened.

:Remark:

    This list may be extended, if needed. clients should treat unknown error classes as generic as possible.


Logging
~~~~~~~

``logging``:
  followed by a specifier of <modulename> and a string in the JSON-part which is either "debug", "info", "error" or is the JSON-value false.
  This is supposed to set the 'logging level' of the given module (or the whole SEC-node if the specifier is empty) to the given level:

  This scheme may also be extended to configure logging only for selected paramters of selected modules.

  :"off":
    Remote logging is completely turned off.
  :"error":
    Only errors are logged remotely.
  :"info":
    Only 'info' and 'error' messages are logged remotely.
  :"debug":
    All log messages are logged remotely.

  A SEC-node should reply with an error-report (``protocolerror``) if it doesn't implement this message.
  Otherwise it should mirror the request, which may be updated with the logging-level actually in use.
  i.e. if an SEC-node does not implement the "debug" level, but "error" and "info" and an ECS request "debug" logging, the
  reply should contain "info" (as this is 'closer' to the original request which than "error" or ``false``).
  Similiarly, if logging of a too specific item is requested, the SEC-node should activate the logging on the
  least specific item where logging is supported. e.g. if logging for <module>:<param> is requested, but the SEC-node
  only support logging of the module, this should be reflected in the reply and the logging of the module is to be influenced.

  :Note: it is not foreseen to query the currently active logging level. It is supposed to default to ``"off"``.

``log``:
  followed by a specifier of <modulename>:<loglevel> and the message to be logged as JSON-string in the datapart.
  This is an asynchronous event only to be sent by the SEC-node to the ECS of it activated logging.


example::

  > logging  "error"           ; note: empty specifier -> select all modules
  < logging  "error"           ; SEC-node confirms
  < log mod1:debug "polling value"
  < log mod1:debug "sending request..."
  ...

another example::

  > logging mod1 "debug"       ; enable full logging of mod1
  < logging mod1 "error"       ; SEC-node can only log errors, logging of errors of mod1 is now active
  < log mod1:error "value par1 can not be determined, please refill read-out liquid"
  ...
  > logging mod1 false
  < logging mod1 false


Heartbeat
~~~~~~~~~

In order to detect that the other end of the communication is not dead,
a heartbeat may be sent. The second part of the message (the id) must
not contain a space and should be short and not be re-used.
It may be omitted. The reply will contain exactly the same id.

A SEC node replies with a ``pong`` message with a `Data report`_ of a null value.
The `Qualifiers`_ part SHOULD only contain the timestamp (as member "t") if the
SEC node supports timestamping.
This can be used to synchronize the time between ECS and SEC node.

:Remark:

    The qualifiers could also be an empty JSON-object, indicating lack of timestamping support.

For debugging purposes, when *id* in the ``ping`` request is omitted,
in the ``pong`` reply there are two spaces after ``pong``.
A client SHOULD always send an id. However, the client parser MUST treat two
consecutive spaces as two separators with an empty string in between.

Example:

.. code::

  > ping 123
  < pong 123 [null, {"t": 1505396348.543}]

Handling timeout Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a timeout happens, it is not easy for the ECS to decide on the best strategy.
Also there are several types of timeout: idle-timeout, reply-timeout, etc...
Generally speaking: both ECS and SEC side needs to be aware that the other
side may close the connection at any time!
On reconnect, it is recommended, that the ECS does send a ``*IDN?`` and a ``describe`` message.
If the reponses match the responses from the previous connection, the ECS should continue
as if no interruption happend.
If the response of the description does not match, it is up to the ECS how to handle this.
Naturally, if the previous connection was activated, an ``activate``
message has to be sent before it can continue as before.

:Related SECoP Issues: `SECoP Issue 4: The Timeout SEC Node Property`_ and `SECoP Issue 6: Keep Alive`_


Multiple Connections
--------------------

A SEC node restrict the number of simultaneous connections, downto 1.
However, each SEC node should support as many connections as technically
feasible.

Details about how to multiplex multiple connections onto one are to be
discussed.


Descriptive Data
================

Format of Descriptive Data
--------------------------

The format of the descriptive data is JSON, as all other data in SECoP.


.. for creating the railroad diagrams see: http://bottlecaps.de/rr/ui
.. source EBNF is now in images/rules.ebnf
.. below railroads were generated differently with a different syntax:
.. each *.svg has a *.txt file which contains the description
.. there is a (not yet checked in) Makefile which re-generates the svg's from the txt's

SEC Node Properties
-------------------

.. image:: images/sec-node-description.svg
   :alt: SEC_node_description ::= '{' (SEC_node_property ( ',' SEC_node_property)* )? '}'


.. image:: images/sec-node-property.svg
   :alt: SEC_node_property ::= property |  ( '"modules":' '[' (name ',' module_description (',' name ',' module_description)*)? ']')

there might be properties such as a timeout which are relevant for the
communication of a SEC node.

-  modules
     mandatory, list of modules and their properties, see `Module Properties`_.

-  equipment_id
     mandatory, worldwide unqiue id of an equipment as string. Should contain the name of the
     owner institute or provider company as prefix in order to guarantee worldwide uniqueness.

     example: ``"MLZ_ccr12"`` or ``"HZB-vm4"``

-  description
     mandatory text describing the node, in general.
     The formatting should follow the 'git' standard, i.e. a short headline (max 72 chars),
     followed by ``\n\n`` and then a more detailed description, using ``\n`` for linebreaks.

-  firmware
     optional, short, string naming the version of the SEC node software.

     example: ``frappy-0.6.0``

-  timeout
     optional value in seconds, a SEC node should be able to respond within
     a time well below this value. (i.e. this is a reply-timeout.)
     Default: 10 sec, *see* `SECoP Issue 4: The Timeout SEC Node Property`_)


Module Properties
-----------------

.. image:: images/module-description.svg
   :alt: module_description ::= '{' (module_property ( ',' module_property)* )? '}'


.. image:: images/module-property.svg
   :alt: module_property ::= property |  ( '"accessibles":' '[' (name ',' properties (',' name ',' properties)*)? ']') ']')

-  accessibles
     mandatory list of accessibles and their properties, see `Accessible Properties`_.

-  description
     mandatory text describing the module, formatted like the node-property description

-  visibility
     optional string indicating a hint for UI's for which user roles the module should be display or hidden.
     MUST be one of "expert" (3), "advanced" (2) or "user" (1) (default).

     :Note:
         this does not imply that the access is controlled. It is just a
         hint to the UI for the amount of exposed modules. A visibility of "advanced" (2) means
         that the UI should hide the module for users, but show it for experts and
         advanced users.

-  interface_class
     mandatory list of matching classes for the module, for example ``["Magnet", "Drivable"]``

     :Note:
        as this is a list it SHOULD actually have been called ``interface_classes`` or ``interfaces``

-  group
     optional identifier, may contain ":" which may be interpreted as path separator.
     The ECS may group the modules according to this property.
     The lowercase version of a group must not match any lowercase version of a module name on
     the same SEC node.

     :related issue: `SECoP Issue 8: Groups and Hierarchy`_

-  meaning
     optional tuple, with the following two elements:

     1. a string from an extensible list of predefined meanings:

        * 'temperature'   (the sample temperature)
        * 'temperature_regulation' (to be specified only if different from 'temperature')
        * 'magneticfield'
        * 'electricfield'
        * 'pressure'
        * 'rotation_z' (counter clockwise when looked at 'from sky to earth')
        * 'humidity'
        * 'viscosity'
        * 'flowrate'
        * 'concentration'

        This list may be extended later.

        '_regulation' may be postfixed, if the quantity generating module is different from the
        (closer to the sample) relevant measuring device. A regulation device MUST have an
        ``interface_class`` of at least ``Writable``.

        :related issue: `SECoP Issue 26: More Module Meanings`_

     2. a value describing the importance, with the following values:

        - 10 means the instrument/beamline (Example: room temperature sensor always present)
        - 20 means the surrounding sample environemnt (Example: VTI temperature)
        - 30 means an insert (Example: sample stick of dilution insert)
        - 40 means an addon added to an insert (Example: a device mounted inside a dilution insert)

        Intermediate values might be used. The range for each category starts at the indicated value minus 5
        and ends below the indicated value plus 5.

        :related issue: `SECoP Issue 9: Module Meaning`_

-  _`implementor`
     The implementor of a module, defining the meaning of custom status values, custom
     properties and custom accessibles. The implementor must be globally unique, for example
     'sinq.psi.ch'. This may be achieved by including a domain name, but it does not need
     to be a registered name, and other means of assuring a global unique name are also possible.
    


Accessible Properties
---------------------
.. image:: images/accessible-description.svg
   :alt: properties ::=  '{' (property ( ',' property)* )? '}'


.. image:: images/accessible-property.svg
   :alt: property ::= (name ":" property_value)

(TODO: Above image to be updated for distinction accessible- / parameter- property)

- description
    mandatory string describing the accessible, formatted as for module-description
    or node-description

- group
    optional identifier, may contain ":" which may be interpreted as path separator.
    The ECS may group the parameters according to this property.
    The lowercase version of a group must not match any lowercase version of an accessible name
    of the same module.

    :related issue: `SECoP Issue 8: Groups and Hierarchy`_

- visibility
    optional, the visibility of the accessible. values and meaning as for module-visibility above.

    :Remark:

        this 'inherits' from the module property. i.e. if it is not specified, the
        value of the module-property (if given) should be used instead

:Remark:

    the accessible-property ``group`` is used for grouping of accesibles within a module,
    the module-property ``group`` is used for grouping of modules within a node.


Parameter Properties
--------------------

- readonly
    mandatory boolean value. Indication if this parameter may be changed by an ECS, or not

- datatype
    mandatory datatype of the accessible, see `Data Types`_.
    This is always a JSON-Array containing at least one element: a string naming the datatype.

    :Note:
        commands and parameters can be distinguished by the datatype.

- constant
    optional. If given, the parameter is constant and has the given value.
    Such a parameter can neither be read nor written, and it will not be transferred
    after the activate command.


Custom Properties
-----------------
Custom properties may further augment accessibles, modules or the SEC-node description.

.. image:: images/custom-property.svg
   :alt: property ::= ("_" name ":" property_value)

As for all custom extensions, the names must be prefixed with an underscore. The meaning
of custom properties is dependent on the implementor, given by the `implementor`_
module property. An ECS not knowing the meaning of a custom property SHOULD ignore it. 


Data Types
==========

SECoP defines a very flexible data typing system. Data types are used to describe
the possible values of parameters and how they are serialized.
They may also impose restrictions on the useable values or amount of data.
Like the integer or fractional data types SECoP defines.
Also an Enum is defined for convenience of not having to remember the meaning of values from a reduced set.
A Bool datatype is similiar to a predefined Enum, but uses the JSON-values true and false.
(Of course 0 should be treated as False and 1 as True if a bool value isn't using the JSON literals.)

Furthermore, SECoP not only defines basic data types but also structured datatypes.
Tuples allow to combine a fixed amount of values with different datatypes in an ordered way to be used as one.
Arrays store a given number of dataelements having the same datatype.
Structs are comparable to tuples, with the difference of using named entries whose order is irrelevant during transport.

For ranges and precisions see `SECoP Issue 42: Requirements of datatypes`_.
The limits, which have to be specified with the datatype, are always inclusive,
i.e. the value is allowed to have one of the values of the limits.
Also, both limits may be set to the same value, in which case there is just one allowed value.

All datatypes are specified in the descriptive data in the following generic form:

.. image:: images/datatype-generic.svg

Here is an overview of all defined datatypes:

double
------

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 80
    :stub-columns: 1

    * - Datatype
      - | ``["double", {<datatype properties>}]``
        | <datatype properties> = ``<name>: <value>, ...``
        | see below

    * - Example

    * - Transport example
      - | as JSON-number:
        | ``3.14159265``

The following datatype properties are defined for ``double``:

- min
    lower limit. if min is omitted, there is no lower limit
    
- max
    upper limit. if max is omitted, there is no upper limit

- unit
    optional string giving the unit of the parameter.
    (default: unitless. SHOULD be given, if meaningfull. empty string: unit is one)
    Only SI-units (including prefix) SHOULD be used for SECoP units preferrably.
    :related: `SECoP Issue 43: Parameters and units`_

    default value: 1.2e-7 (enough for single precision floats)

    if both ``absolute_resolution`` and ``relative_resolution`` are given, the expected

scaled integers
---------------

Scaled integers are to be treated as 'double' in the ECS, they are just transported
differently. The main motivation for this datatype is for SEC nodes with limited
capabilities, where floating point calculation is a major effort.


.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 80
    :stub-columns: 1

    * - Datatype
      - | ``["scaled", {"scale": scale, "min": <min>, "max": <max> <datatype properties>}]``
        | <datatype properties> = ``, <name>: <value>, ...``
        |
        | ``scale``, ``<min>`` and ``<max>`` MUST be given
        | ``<min>`` and ``<max>`` are integers with ``<min>`` <= ``<max>``
        | ``<scale>`` is a number > 0

    * - Example
      - ``["scaled", {"scale": 0.1, "min": 0, "max": 250}]``
        i.e. a double value between 0.0 and 25.0

    * - Transport examples
      - | An integer JSON-number, ``1255`` meaning 125.5

In addition to ``scale``, ``min`` and ``max`` the following datatype properties are defined for ``scaled``:

- unit
    optional string giving the unit of the parameter.
    (default: unitless. SHOULD be given, if meaningfull. empty string: unit is one)
    Only SI-units (including prefix) SHOULD be used for SECoP units preferrably.
    :related: `SECoP Issue 43: Parameters and units`_

- absolute_resolution
    optional, JSON-number specifying the smallest difference between distinct values.
    default value: ``scale``
    
- relative_resolution
    optional, JSON-number specifying the smallest relative difference
    between distinct values:
    
    ``abs(a-b) <= relative_resolution * max(abs(a),abs(b))``
    
    default value: 1.2e-7 (enough for single precision floats)

    if both ``absolute_resolution`` and ``relative_resolution`` are given, the expected
    resolution is:
    
    ``max(absolute_resolution, abs(value) * relative_resolution)``

    :related: `SECoP Issue 49: Precision of Floating Point Values`_

- fmtstr
    optional string as a hint on how to format numeric parameters for the user.
    default value: "%.<n>f" where <n> = max(0,-floor(log10(scale)))

    The string must follow the following syntax (TODO: update image to allow "%.0f")\:

    .. image:: images/fmtstr.svg

    * - Datatype
      - | ``["command", {}]``
        | ``["command", {"argument": <argumenttype>}]``
        | ``["command", {"result": <resulttype>}]``
        | ``["command", {"argument": <argumenttype>, "result": <resulttype>}]``
        |
        | if ``<argumenttype>`` is omitted, the command has no argument
        | if ``<resulttype>`` is omitted, the command returns no result
        | only one argument is allowed, though several arguments may be used if
        | encapsulated in a structural datatype (struct, tuple or array).
        | If such encapsulation or data grouping is needed, a struct SHOULD be used.
        | In any case, the meaning of result and argument(s) SHOULD be written down
        | in the description of the command.

    * - Example
      - ``["command", {"argument": ["bool", {}], "result": ["bool", {}]]``

    * - Transport examples
      - | > ``do module:invert true``
        | < ``done module:invert [false,{t:123456789.2}]``



Future Compatibility - notes for implementors
=============================================
.. _`future compatibility`:


Data transfer
-------------

SECoP relies on a stream transport of 8-bit bytes. Most often this will be TCP.
In those cases the SEC-node SHOULD support several simultaneous connections.

RS232 style connections may also be used. Here, only a single connection can be used.
If several connections are needed, a 'multiplexer' is needed.
This should offer multiple TCP connections and contain the necessary logic to map requests/replies from/to those
network connections onto/from the serial connection to the actual SEC-node.


Foreseen extension mechanisms
-----------------------------

The herein specified protocol has foreseen some extension mechanisms in its design:

* add actions, keeping the 'triple' structure of action/specifier/data

  :Note:
      Thats why custom actions MUST be prefixed with an underscore.

* extent specifier with ':' separated identifiers, getting more and more specific

  An empty string as specifier adresses the SEC-node, ``<module>`` adresses a module,
  and ``<module>:<accessible>`` adresses an accessible of a module.

  If there will ever by such things as node-accessibles, they will be adressed as ``:<accessible>``.
  Also properties may be adresses like ``<module>:<accessible>:<property>``.

  In the same sense as an empty string selects the whole SEC-node, ``<module>:`` may select ALL parameters of a module.

* define additional parameter/command/property names

* extend reports (only append to them, never changing the already defined fields)

  :Note:
      The structure report may need to be nested inside a json-array in the future, should we need to extend that.

* use so far unused datafields (there are not so many).

* define additional status groups or statuscodes

* define additional interface classes/features


Message handling
----------------

This specification defines a set of requests and replies above.
Only those messages are ALLOWED to be generated by any software complying to this specification:

.. compound::
    Requests:

    .. image:: images/defined-requests.svg
       :alt: defined_requests

.. compound::
    Replies:

    .. image:: images/defined-replies.svg
       :alt: defined_replies

The specification is intended to grow and adopt to new needs. (related issue `SECoP Issue 38: Extension mechanisms`_)
To future proof the the communication the following messages MUST be parsed and treated correctly
(i.e. the ignored_value part is to be ignored).

.. compound::
    Requests:

    .. image:: images/must-accept-requests.svg
       :alt: must_accept_requests

.. compound::
    Replies:

    .. image:: images/must-accept-replies.svg
       :alt: must_accept_replies

As a special case, an argumentless command may also by called without specifying the data part.
In this case an argument of null is to be assumed.
Also, an argumentless ping is to be handled as a ping request with an empty token string.
The corresponding reply then contains a double space. This MUST also be parsed correctly.

Similiarly, the reports need to be handled like this:

.. compound::
    Data report:

    .. image:: images/data-report.svg
       :alt: data_report ::= "[" json-value "," qualifiers ("," ignored_value)* "]"

.. compound::
    Error report:

    .. image:: images/error-report.svg
       :alt: error_report ::= '["' copy_of_request '","' error_msg '",' error_info ("," ignored_value)* "]"

Essentially this boils down to:
  1) ignore additional entries in the list-part of reports
  #) ignore extra keys in the qualifiers, structure report and error report mappings
  #) ignore message fields which are not used in the definition of the messages (i.e. for `describe`)
  #) treat needed, but missing data as null (or an empty string, depending on context)
  #) if a specifier contains more ":" than you can handle, use the part you understand, ignore the rest.
     (i.e. treat ``activate module:parameter`` as ``activate module``, ignoring the ``:parameter`` part)
     (i.e. treat ``error BadValue:WrongType`` as ``error BadValue``, ignoring the ``:WrongType`` part)
  #) upon parsing a value, when you know it should be one element from an Enum (which SHOULD be transported as integer),
     if you find a string instead and that string is one of the names from the Enum, use that entry.
  #) check newer versions of the specification and check the issues as well, as the above may change.

Complying to these rules maximize to possibility of future + backwards compatibility.

:Note:
    also check `SECoP Issue 36: Dynamic units`_ *as it may have implications for a certain implementation.*


Binary representations of the protocol
--------------------------------------

so far only the above described, textual protocol is defined.
Since this is not optimal for bandwith limited connections (e.g. RS232), a shorter, binary representation
may be developed. This will essentially keep the structure of the messages, but replace the components
of a message with shorter, binary representations.

Good candidates for this are CBOR (see :RFC:`7049`) and MessagePack (see https://msgpack.org/).


Security and access control
===========================

SECoP does not handle security of transferred data nor access control and relies on support by other means.
