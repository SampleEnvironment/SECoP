Motivation
==========

 * SECoP motivation proposal
 * simple, inclusive and self describing
 * write drivers only once
 * different institutes wrote their own driver collection which fulfils all their needs and it works reliable 
 * as secondary effect the standard drivers still can be used so their are well tested and may become more reliable

SECoP
-----

The SECoP (Sample Environment Communication Protocol) is an Inclusive, Simple and Self Explaining (ISSE) communication protocol.
Inclusive means, that facilities can use this protocol and don't have to change their work flow (rewrite drivers completely or organize and handle hardware in a specific way to fulfil SECoP requirements).
Simple means it should be easy to integrate and to use.
Self Explaining means that with SECoP, not only the pure data is transported. It also transports meta data, which allows environment control software to configure by itself.
The benefit of SECoP will be to circulate expensive devices between different facilities with minimised effort for configuration and integration.
This should result in an increased utilisation of expensive equipment.
